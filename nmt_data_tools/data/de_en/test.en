you know , one of the inten@@ se pleas@@ ures of travel and one of the deli@@ ghts of eth@@ no@@ graphic research is the opportunity to live am@@ on@@ gst those who have not for@@ gotten the old ways , who still feel their past in the wind , touch it in st@@ ones poli@@ shed by rain , taste it in the bit@@ ter leaves of plants .
just to know that ja@@ gu@@ ar sh@@ am@@ ans still journey beyond the mil@@ ky way , or the my@@ ths of the in@@ u@@ it el@@ ders still res@@ on@@ ate with meaning , or that in the hi@@ mal@@ a@@ ya , the budd@@ hi@@ sts still pur@@ sue the breath of the d@@ har@@ ma , is to really remember the central re@@ vel@@ ation of anthropo@@ log@@ y , and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not exist in some absolute sense , but is just one model of reality , the con@@ sequence of one particular set of adap@@ tive choices that our lin@@ e@@ age made , al@@ b@@ eit success@@ fully , many generations ago .
and of course , we all share the same adap@@ tive im@@ per@@ a@@ tives .
we &apos;re all born . we all bring our children into the world .
we go through initi@@ ation ri@@ tes .
we have to deal with the in@@ ex@@ or@@ able separ@@ ation of death , so it shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all sing , we all dance , we all have art .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique ca@@ dence of the song , the rhyth@@ m of the dance in every culture .
and whether it is the pen@@ an in the fore@@ sts of bor@@ ne@@ o , or the vo@@ o@@ do@@ o ac@@ oly@@ tes in haiti , or the war@@ ri@@ ors in the ka@@ is@@ ut desert of northern kenya , the cur@@ ander@@ o in the mountains of the and@@ es , or a car@@ a@@ van@@ ser@@ ai in the middle of the sahar@@ a -- this is inci@@ dent@@ ally the fellow that i travel@@ ed into the desert with a month ago -- or indeed a y@@ ak her@@ der in the slo@@ pes of q@@ om@@ ol@@ ang@@ ma , ever@@ est , the go@@ dd@@ ess mother of the world .
all of these peop@@ les teach us that there are other ways of being , other ways of thinking , other ways of ori@@ enting yourself in the earth .
and this is an idea , if you think about it , can only fill you with hope .
now , together the my@@ ri@@ ad cultures of the world make up a web of spi@@ ritual life and cultural life that en@@ vel@@ ops the planet , and is as important to the well-@@ being of the planet as indeed is the biological web of life that you know as a bio@@ sphere .
and you might think of this cultural web of life as being an eth@@ no@@ sphere , and you might define the eth@@ no@@ sphere as being the sum total of all thoughts and dreams , my@@ ths , ideas , inspi@@ ra@@ tions , intui@@ tions brought into being by the human imagination since the da@@ wn of consciousness .
the eth@@ no@@ sphere is humanity &apos;s great leg@@ acy .
it &apos;s the symbol of all that we are and all that we can be as an ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ingly in@@ qu@@ isi@@ tive species .
and just as the bio@@ sphere has been sever@@ ely ero@@ ded , so too is the eth@@ no@@ sphere -- and , if anything , at a far greater rate .
no bi@@ ologists , for example , would d@@ are suggest that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are on the br@@ ink of extin@@ ction because it simply is not true , and yet that -- the most apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic scen@@ ari@@ o in the real@@ m of biological diversity -- sc@@ arc@@ ely approach@@ es what we know to be the most optimi@@ stic scen@@ ari@@ o in the real@@ m of cultural diversity .
and the great indi@@ c@@ ator of that , of course , is language loss .
when each of you in this room were born , there were 6@@ ,000 languages spo@@ ken on the planet .
now , a language is not just a body of vo@@ cab@@ ul@@ ary or a set of gra@@ m@@ ma@@ tical rules .
a language is a flas@@ h of the human spirit .
it &apos;s a vehicle through which the sou@@ l of each particular culture comes into the material world .
every language is an ol@@ d-@@ growth forest of the mind , a water@@ shed , a thought , an ecosystem of spi@@ ritual possibilities .
and of those 6@@ ,000 languages , as we sit here today in mon@@ ter@@ ey , fully half are no longer being wh@@ is@@ per@@ ed into the e@@ ars of children .
they &apos;re no longer being taught to babies , which means , effectively , unless something changes , they &apos;re already dead .
what could be more lon@@ ely than to be en@@ vel@@ op@@ ed in sil@@ ence , to be the last of your people to speak your language , to have no way to pass on the wisdom of the ancestors or anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ te the promise of the children ?
and yet , that dre@@ ad@@ ful fa@@ te is indeed the p@@ light of somebody somewhere on earth roughly every two weeks , because every two weeks , some el@@ der dies and car@@ ries with him into the gra@@ ve the last sy@@ ll@@ ables of an ancient ton@@ gue .
and i know there &apos;s some of you who say , &quot; well , wouldn &apos;t it be better , wouldn &apos;t the world be a better place if we all just spoke one language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; great , let &apos;s make that language yor@@ u@@ ba . let &apos;s make it c@@ ant@@ on@@ ese .
let &apos;s make it kog@@ i . &quot;
and you &apos;ll suddenly discover what it would be like to be un@@ able to speak your own language .
and so , what i &apos;d like to do with you today is sort of take you on a journey through the eth@@ no@@ sphere , a brief journey through the eth@@ no@@ sphere , to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost .
now , there are many of us who sort of forget that when i say &quot; different ways of being , &quot; i really do mean different ways of being .
take , for example , this child of a bar@@ as@@ ana in the nor@@ th@@ west ama@@ zon , the people of the an@@ ac@@ on@@ da who believe that my@@ th@@ ologi@@ cally they came up the milk river from the east in the bel@@ ly of sac@@ red sna@@ kes .
now , this is a people who cogni@@ tively do not dist@@ ingu@@ ish the color blue from the color green because the can@@ op@@ y of the hea@@ v@@ ens is equ@@ ated to the can@@ op@@ y of the forest upon which the people dep@@ end .
they have a curious language and marriage rule which is called &quot; l@@ ingu@@ i@@ stic ex@@ og@@ am@@ y : &quot; you must mar@@ ry someone who spea@@ ks a different language .
and this is all ro@@ ot@@ ed in the my@@ th@@ ological past , yet the curious thing is in these long houses , where there are six or seven languages spo@@ ken because of inter@@ marriage , you never hear anyone practic@@ ing a language .
they simply listen and then begin to speak .
or , one of the most fascinating tri@@ bes i ever lived with , the wa@@ or@@ an@@ i of nor@@ the@@ astern ecu@@ ad@@ or , an ast@@ on@@ ishing people first cont@@ ac@@ ted pe@@ ac@@ efully in 195@@ 8 .
in 195@@ 7 , five mis@@ sion@@ aries attemp@@ ted contact and made a critical mistake .
they dro@@ pped from the air 8 x 10 glo@@ ss@@ y photographs of themselves in what we would say to be friend@@ ly gest@@ ures , for@@ getting that these people of the rain@@ forest had never seen anything two-@@ dimensional in their lives .
they picked up these photographs from the forest floor , tried to look behind the face to find the form or the figure , found nothing , and conclu@@ ded that these were calling cards from the de@@ vil , so they spe@@ ared the five mis@@ sion@@ aries to death .
but the wa@@ or@@ an@@ i didn &apos;t just spe@@ ar out@@ si@@ ders .
they spe@@ ared each other .
5@@ 4 percent of their mortality was due to them spe@@ aring each other .
we tra@@ ced gene@@ alo@@ gi@@ es back eight generations , and we found two in@@ stances of natural death and when we pres@@ su@@ red the people a little bit about it , they ad@@ mit@@ ted that one of the fel@@ lo@@ ws had gotten so old that he died getting old , so we spe@@ ared him anyway .
but at the same time they had a per@@ sp@@ ic@@ aci@@ ous knowledge of the forest that was ast@@ on@@ ishing .
their h@@ unter@@ s could smell animal ur@@ ine at 40 pac@@ es and tell you what species left it behind .
in the early &apos; 8@@ 0s , i had a really ast@@ on@@ ishing as@@ sign@@ ment when i was asked by my professor at harvard if i was interested in going down to haiti , in@@ fil@@ tr@@ ating the secret societies which were the foundation of du@@ v@@ ali@@ er &apos;s strength and ton@@ ton ma@@ cou@@ tes , and se@@ cur@@ ing the po@@ ison used to make z@@ om@@ bi@@ es .
in order to make sense out of sen@@ sation , of course , i had to understand something about this remarkable faith of vo@@ dou@@ n . and vo@@ o@@ do@@ o is not a black magic cul@@ t .
on the contr@@ ary , it &apos;s a complex meta@@ physical world@@ view .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i asked you to name the great religi@@ ons of the world , what would you say ?
chri@@ sti@@ an@@ ity , islam , budd@@ h@@ ism , ju@@ da@@ ism , whatever .
there &apos;s always one continent left out , the assu@@ mption being that sub-@@ sahar@@ an africa had no religious belie@@ fs . well , of course , they did and vo@@ o@@ do@@ o is simply the dist@@ il@@ lation of these very profound religious ideas that came over during the tra@@ gic di@@ as@@ por@@ a of the sla@@ very era .
but , what makes vo@@ o@@ do@@ o so interesting is that it &apos;s this living relationship between the living and the dead .
so , the living give birth to the spi@@ ri@@ ts .
the spi@@ ri@@ ts can be inv@@ o@@ ked from bene@@ ath the great water , respon@@ ding to the rhyth@@ m of the dance to moment@@ arily dis@@ place the sou@@ l of the living , so that for that brief sh@@ ining moment , the ac@@ oly@@ te becomes the god .
that &apos;s why the vo@@ o@@ do@@ o@@ ists like to say that &quot; you white people go to church and speak about god .
we dance in the temp@@ le and become god . &quot;
and because you are pos@@ s@@ essed , you are taken by the spirit -- how can you be har@@ med ?
so you see these ast@@ on@@ ishing demon@@ stra@@ tions : vo@@ o@@ do@@ o ac@@ oly@@ tes in a state of tr@@ ance hand@@ ling burning em@@ bers with im@@ pun@@ ity , a rather ast@@ on@@ ishing demon@@ stration of the ability of the mind to affect the body that be@@ ars it when cat@@ aly@@ zed in the state of extreme exc@@ it@@ ation .
now , of all the peop@@ les that i &apos;ve ever been with , the most extraordinary are the kog@@ i of the si@@ er@@ ra ne@@ v@@ ada de s@@ ant@@ a mar@@ ta in northern col@@ om@@ bia .
des@@ cen@@ dan@@ ts of the ancient ta@@ ir@@ on@@ a civilization which once car@@ pe@@ ted the car@@ ib@@ be@@ an co@@ ast@@ al pla@@ in of col@@ om@@ bia , in the wake of the con@@ qu@@ est , these people re@@ treated into an isol@@ ated vol@@ can@@ ic massi@@ f that so@@ ars above the car@@ ib@@ be@@ an co@@ ast@@ al pla@@ in .
in a b@@ loo@@ d@@ sta@@ ined continent , these people alone were never con@@ qu@@ ered by the span@@ ish .
to this day , they re@@ main rul@@ ed by a ritual pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od but the training for the pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od is rather extraordinary .
the young ac@@ oly@@ tes are taken away from their families at the age of three and four , sequ@@ e@@ ster@@ ed in a sha@@ dow@@ y world of dar@@ k@@ ness in stone hu@@ ts at the base of gl@@ aci@@ ers for 18 years : two nin@@ e-@@ year peri@@ ods deli@@ ber@@ ately cho@@ sen to mi@@ mic the nine months of gest@@ ation they spend in their natural mother &apos;s wom@@ b ; now they are metaph@@ or@@ ically in the wom@@ b of the great mother .
and for this entire time , they are in@@ cul@@ tur@@ ated into the values of their society , values that main@@ tain the pro@@ position that their pra@@ yers and their pra@@ yers alone main@@ tain the co@@ s@@ mic -- or we might say the e@@ col@@ o@@ gical -- balance .
and at the end of this amazing initi@@ ation , one day they &apos;re suddenly taken out and for the first time in their lives , at the age of 18 , they see a sun@@ rise . and in that cr@@ y@@ st@@ al moment of awareness of first light as the sun begins to ba@@ the the slo@@ pes of the stun@@ n@@ ingly beautiful landscape , suddenly everything they have learned in the abstra@@ ct is aff@@ ir@@ med in stun@@ ning gl@@ ory . and the pri@@ est steps back and says , &quot; you see ? it &apos;s really as i &apos;ve told you .
it is that beautiful . it is y@@ ours to protect . &quot;
they call themselves the &quot; el@@ der brothers &quot; and they say we , who are the yo@@ unger brothers , are the ones responsible for destro@@ ying the world .
now , this level of intuition becomes very important .
whenever we think of indi@@ gen@@ ous people and landscape , we either inv@@ o@@ ke r@@ ous@@ se@@ au and the old can@@ ard of the &quot; no@@ ble sav@@ age , &quot; which is an idea ra@@ c@@ ist in its simpli@@ city , or alterna@@ tively , we inv@@ o@@ ke th@@ ore@@ au and say these people are closer to the earth than we are .
well , indi@@ gen@@ ous people are nei@@ ther sen@@ ti@@ mental nor we@@ ak@@ en@@ ed by no@@ stal@@ gi@@ a .
there &apos;s not a lot of room for either in the malari@@ al s@@ w@@ am@@ ps of the as@@ m@@ at or in the chil@@ ling win@@ ds of ti@@ bet , but they have , ne@@ ver@@ th@@ eless , through time and ritual , for@@ ged a traditional my@@ sti@@ que of the earth that is based not on the idea of being self-@@ consci@@ ously close to it , but on a far sub@@ t@@ ler intuition : the idea that the earth itself can only exist because it is brea@@ th@@ ed into being by human consciousness .
now , what does that mean ?
it means that a young kid from the and@@ es who &apos;s raised to believe that that mountain is an ap@@ u spirit that will direct his or her dest@@ in@@ y will be a pro@@ fo@@ und@@ ly different human being and have a different relationship to that resource or that place than a young kid from mon@@ tan@@ a raised to believe that a mountain is a pi@@ le of rock ready to be min@@ ed .
whether it &apos;s the abo@@ de of a spirit or a pi@@ le of ore is ir@@ relevant .
what &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that defin@@ es the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
i was raised in the fore@@ sts of british colum@@ bia to believe those fore@@ sts exi@@ sted to be cut .
that made me a different human being than my friends am@@ on@@ gst the k@@ wa@@ gi@@ ul@@ th who believe that those fore@@ sts were the abo@@ de of hu@@ x@@ wh@@ u@@ k@@ w and the cro@@ o@@ ked be@@ ak of hea@@ ven and the can@@ ni@@ b@@ al spi@@ ri@@ ts that d@@ well@@ ed at the north end of the world , spi@@ ri@@ ts they would have to engage during their ha@@ ma@@ ts@@ a initi@@ ation .
now , if you begin to look at the idea that these cultures could create different reali@@ ties , you could begin to understand some of their extraordinary disco@@ ver@@ ies . take this plant here .
it &apos;s a photograph i took in the nor@@ th@@ west ama@@ zon just last apri@@ l .
this is ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca , which many of you have heard about , the most powerful psycho@@ active prepar@@ ation of the sha@@ man &apos;s re@@ per@@ toi@@ re .
what makes ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca fascinating is not the she@@ er pharma@@ col@@ o@@ gical potential of this prepar@@ ation , but the el@@ abor@@ ation of it . it &apos;s made really of two different sources : on the one hand , this woo@@ dy li@@ ana which has in it a series of be@@ ta@@ -@@ carb@@ ol@@ ines , har@@ mine , har@@ mal@@ ine , mil@@ dly hallu@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic -- to take the v@@ ine alone is rather to have sort of blue ha@@ zy smo@@ ke dri@@ ft across your consciousness -- but it &apos;s mix@@ ed with the leaves of a s@@ hr@@ u@@ b in the coffee family called psych@@ ot@@ ri@@ a vi@@ ri@@ d@@ is .
this plant had in it some very powerful tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ines , very close to brain ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in , di@@ meth@@ yl@@ tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine , 5@@ -@@ metho@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ meth@@ yl@@ tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine .
if you &apos;ve ever seen the y@@ an@@ o@@ mam@@ i blo@@ wing that s@@ nu@@ ff up their no@@ ses , that sub@@ stance they make from a different set of species also con@@ tains metho@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ meth@@ yl@@ tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine .
to have that po@@ w@@ der blo@@ wn up your nose is rather like being shot out of a ri@@ f@@ le bar@@ re@@ l lin@@ ed with b@@ aro@@ que pain@@ t@@ ings and land@@ ing on a sea of electricity .
it doesn &apos;t create the di@@ stor@@ tion of reality ; it creates the dis@@ solution of reality .
in fact , i used to argue with my professor , richard ev@@ an sh@@ ul@@ tes -- who is a man who spar@@ ked the psy@@ che@@ deli@@ c era with his discovery of the magic mush@@ rooms in mexico in the 193@@ 0s -- i used to argue that you couldn &apos;t classi@@ fy these tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ines as hallu@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic because by the time you &apos;re under the effects there &apos;s no one home anymore to experience a hallu@@ cin@@ ation .
but the thing about tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ines is they cannot be taken or@@ ally because they &apos;re den@@ at@@ u@@ red by an enzy@@ me found naturally in the human gut called mon@@ o@@ am@@ ine o@@ xi@@ d@@ ase .
they can only be taken or@@ ally if taken in con@@ jun@@ ction with some other chemical that den@@ atures the ma@@ o .
now , the fascinating things are that the be@@ ta@@ -@@ carb@@ ol@@ ines found within that li@@ ana are ma@@ o in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors of the pre@@ cise sort necessary to poten@@ ti@@ ate the tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine . so you ask yourself a question .
how , in a fl@@ or@@ a of 8@@ 0,000 species of vas@@ cular plants , do these people find these two mor@@ ph@@ ologi@@ cally un@@ related plants that when combin@@ ed in this way , created a kind of bio@@ chemical version of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts ?
well , we use that great eu@@ p@@ he@@ mis@@ m , &quot; trial and er@@ ror , &quot; which is ex@@ posed to be meaning@@ less .
but you ask the indi@@ ans , and they say , &quot; the plants talk to us . &quot;
well , what does that mean ?
this tri@@ be , the co@@ fan , has 17 var@@ ie@@ ties of ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca , all of which they dist@@ ingu@@ ish a great distance in the forest , all of which are refer@@ able to our eye as one species .
and then you ask them how they establi@@ sh their tax@@ on@@ om@@ y and they say , &quot; i thought you knew something about plants .
i mean , don &apos;t you know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
well , it turns out you take each of the 17 var@@ ie@@ ties in the night of a full moon , and it s@@ ings to you in a different key .
now , that &apos;s not going to get you a ph@@ .@@ d. at harvard , but it &apos;s a lot more interesting than coun@@ ting stam@@ ens .
now -- -- the problem -- the problem is that even those of us sym@@ pa@@ thetic with the p@@ light of indi@@ gen@@ ous people view them as qua@@ int and color@@ ful but somehow re@@ duced to the mar@@ g@@ ins of history as the real world , meaning our world , moves on .
well , the truth is the 20th century , 300 years from now , is not going to be remem@@ ber@@ ed for its wars or its technologi@@ cal innova@@ tions , but rather as the era in which we stood by and either ac@@ tively end@@ or@@ sed or passi@@ vely accep@@ ted the massive destruction of both biological and cultural diversity on the planet . now , the problem isn &apos;t change .
all cultures through all time have constantly been enga@@ ged in a dance with new possibilities of life .
and the problem is not technology itself .
the si@@ ou@@ x indi@@ ans did not stop being si@@ ou@@ x when they gave up the bo@@ w and ar@@ row any more than an american stopped being an american when he gave up the horse and bu@@ g@@ g@@ y .
it &apos;s not change or technology that thre@@ at@@ ens the integri@@ ty of the eth@@ no@@ sphere . it is power , the cru@@ de face of dom@@ ination .
wher@@ ever you look around the world , you discover that these are not cultures dest@@ ined to fa@@ de away ; these are dynamic living peop@@ les being driven out of existence by identi@@ fi@@ able forces that are beyond their capacity to ada@@ pt to : whether it &apos;s the e@@ gre@@ gi@@ ous de@@ for@@ est@@ ation in the hom@@ eland of the pen@@ an -- a no@@ ma@@ di@@ c people from sou@@ the@@ ast asia , from sar@@ a@@ wa@@ k -- a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago , and now have all been re@@ duced to ser@@ vi@@ tude and pro@@ stit@@ ution on the ban@@ ks of the ri@@ vers , where you can see the river itself is so@@ iled with the si@@ lt that seems to be carrying half of bor@@ ne@@ o away to the south china sea , where the japanese frei@@ gh@@ ters hang light in the hori@@ zon ready to fill their hol@@ ds with ra@@ w lo@@ gs ri@@ pped from the forest -- or , in the case of the y@@ an@@ o@@ mam@@ i , it &apos;s the disease enti@@ ties that have come in , in the wake of the discovery of gold .
or if we go into the mountains of ti@@ bet , where i &apos;m doing a lot of research recently , you &apos;ll see it &apos;s a cru@@ de face of political dom@@ ination .
you know , geno@@ cide , the physical extin@@ ction of a people is univer@@ s@@ ally con@@ dem@@ ned , but eth@@ no@@ cide , the destruction of people &apos;s way of life , is not only not con@@ dem@@ ned , it &apos;s univer@@ s@@ ally , in many quar@@ ters , cele@@ br@@ ated as part of a development strategy .
and you cannot understand the pain of ti@@ bet until you move through it at the ground level .
i once tra@@ v@@ ell@@ ed 6@@ ,000 miles from ch@@ eng@@ du in western china over@@ land through sou@@ the@@ astern ti@@ bet to l@@ has@@ a with a young collea@@ gue , and it was only when i got to l@@ has@@ a that i understood the face behind the statistics you hear about : 6@@ ,000 sac@@ red mon@@ um@@ ents tor@@ n apart to d@@ ust and as@@ hes , 1.@@ 2 million people killed by the c@@ ad@@ r@@ es during the cultural revolution .
this young man &apos;s father had been as@@ cri@@ bed to the pan@@ chen lam@@ a .
that meant he was inst@@ antly killed at the time of the chinese invasi@@ on .
his un@@ cle fl@@ ed with his hol@@ iness in the di@@ as@@ por@@ a that took the people to ne@@ p@@ al .
his mother was in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated for the crime of being weal@@ thy .
he was s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ed into the ja@@ il at the age of two to hi@@ de bene@@ ath her sk@@ ir@@ t ta@@ ils because she couldn &apos;t bear to be without him .
the sister who had done that bra@@ ve de@@ ed was put into an education camp .
one day she in@@ ad@@ ver@@ t@@ ently ste@@ pped on an arm@@ band of ma@@ o , and for that trans@@ gr@@ ession , she was given seven years of hard labor .
the pain of ti@@ bet can be impossible to bear , but the re@@ de@@ mp@@ tive spirit of the people is something to beh@@ old .
and in the end , then , it really comes down to a choice : do we want to live in a mon@@ o@@ chro@@ matic world of mon@@ ot@@ ony or do we want to embra@@ ce a poly@@ chro@@ matic world of diversity ?
mar@@ gar@@ et me@@ ad , the great anthropo@@ log@@ ist , said , before she died , that her greatest fear was that as we dri@@ f@@ ted towards this bl@@ and@@ ly am@@ or@@ ph@@ ous gener@@ ic world view not only would we see the entire range of the human imagination re@@ duced to a more nar@@ row mod@@ ality of thought , but that we would wake from a dream one day having for@@ gotten there were even other possibilities .
and it &apos;s hum@@ bling to remember that our species has , perhaps , been around for &#91; 15@@ 0,000 &#93; years .
the ne@@ oli@@ th@@ ic revolution -- which gave us agriculture , at which time we suc@@ cum@@ bed to the cul@@ t of the se@@ ed ; the poetry of the sha@@ man was dis@@ placed by the pro@@ se of the pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od ; we created hier@@ arch@@ y speci@@ alization sur@@ plus -- is only 10,000 years ago .
the modern industrial world as we know it is bar@@ ely 300 years old .
now , that s@@ hal@@ low history doesn &apos;t suggest to me that we have all the answers for all of the challenges that will con@@ front us in the en@@ su@@ ing mil@@ len@@ nia .
when these my@@ ri@@ ad cultures of the world are asked the meaning of being human , they respond with 10,000 different voices .
and it &apos;s within that song that we will all re@@ discover the possibility of being what we are : a fully conscious species , fully aware of en@@ sur@@ ing that all peop@@ les and all gar@@ dens find a way to fl@@ our@@ ish . and there are great moments of optimis@@ m .
this is a photograph i took at the northern ti@@ p of ba@@ ff@@ in island when i went nar@@ wh@@ al hun@@ ting with some in@@ u@@ it people , and this man , ol@@ ay@@ u@@ k , told me a mar@@ vel@@ ous story of his grand@@ father .
the can@@ adi@@ an government has not always been kind to the in@@ u@@ it people , and during the 195@@ 0s , to establi@@ sh our so@@ ver@@ eig@@ n@@ ty , we forced them into sett@@ le@@ ments .
this old man &apos;s grand@@ father re@@ f@@ used to go .
the family , fe@@ ar@@ ful for his life , took away all of his weapons , all of his tools .
now , you must understand that the in@@ u@@ it did not fear the cold ; they took advantage of it .
the run@@ ners of their sle@@ ds were origin@@ ally made of fish wra@@ pped in car@@ i@@ bo@@ u hi@@ de .
so , this man &apos;s grand@@ father was not inti@@ mid@@ ated by the arc@@ tic night or the bli@@ zz@@ ard that was blo@@ wing .
he simply sli@@ pped outside , pulled down his se@@ al@@ skin tr@@ ous@@ ers and de@@ fe@@ cated into his hand . and as the fe@@ ces began to free@@ ze , he sha@@ ped it into the form of a bla@@ de .
he put a spra@@ y of s@@ ali@@ va on the edge of the sh@@ it kni@@ fe and as it finally fro@@ ze soli@@ d , he bu@@ t@@ cher@@ ed a dog with it .
he sk@@ inn@@ ed the dog and impro@@ vis@@ ed a har@@ ness , took the ri@@ b@@ c@@ age of the dog and impro@@ vis@@ ed a s@@ led , har@@ n@@ essed up an ad@@ jac@@ ent dog , and disappe@@ ared over the ice flo@@ es , sh@@ it kni@@ fe in b@@ elt .
talk about getting by with nothing .
and this , in many ways -- -- is a symbol of the resili@@ ence of the in@@ u@@ it people and of all indi@@ gen@@ ous people around the world .
the can@@ adi@@ an government in apri@@ l of 199@@ 9 gave back to total control of the in@@ u@@ it an area of land larger than california and texas put together .
it &apos;s our new hom@@ eland . it &apos;s called n@@ un@@ a@@ v@@ ut .
it &apos;s an independent terri@@ tory . they control all miner@@ al resources .
an amazing example of how a nation@@ -@@ state can se@@ ek re@@ stit@@ ution with its people .
and finally , in the end , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious at least to all of all us who &apos;ve travel@@ ed in these remote reach@@ es of the planet , to realize that they &apos;re not remote at all .
they &apos;re hom@@ el@@ ands of somebody .
they represent bran@@ ches of the human imagination that go back to the da@@ wn of time . and for all of us , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our own children , become part of the na@@ ked geogra@@ ph@@ y of hope .
so , what we &apos;re trying to do at the national geographic , finally , is , we believe that politicians will never ac@@ compli@@ sh anything .
we think that po@@ le@@ mi@@ cs -- -- we think that po@@ le@@ mi@@ cs are not per@@ su@@ asi@@ ve , but we think that story@@ telling can change the world , and so we are probably the best story@@ telling institution in the world . we get 35 million hits on our website every month .
15@@ 6 nations carry our television chan@@ nel .
our maga@@ zin@@ es are read by millions .
and what we &apos;re doing is a series of jour@@ ne@@ ys to the eth@@ no@@ sphere where we &apos;re going to take our audience to places of such cultural wonder that they cannot help but come away da@@ zz@@ led by what they have seen , and hopefully , therefore , embra@@ ce gradu@@ ally , one by one , the central re@@ vel@@ ation of anthropo@@ log@@ y : that this world deser@@ ves to exist in a diver@@ se way , that we can find a way to live in a truly mul@@ tic@@ ul@@ tural , pl@@ ur@@ ali@@ stic world where all of the wisdom of all peop@@ les can contribu@@ te to our collective well-@@ being .
thank you very much .
what i &apos;m going to show you first , as quickly as i can , is some foun@@ da@@ tional work , some new technology that we brought to microsoft as part of an ac@@ qu@@ isi@@ tion almost exactly a year ago . this is se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on , and it &apos;s an environment in which you can either lo@@ cally or re@@ mot@@ ely interact with vast amo@@ unts of visual data .
we &apos;re looking at many , many gi@@ gab@@ y@@ tes of digital photos here and kind of se@@ am@@ less@@ ly and continu@@ ously zo@@ om@@ ing in , pan@@ ning through the thing , re@@ ar@@ ran@@ ging it in any way we want .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how much information we &apos;re looking at , how big these colle@@ ctions are or how big the images are .
most of them are ordinary digital camera photos , but this one , for example , is a scan from the library of con@@ gress , and it &apos;s in the 300 me@@ g@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ el range .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that ought to li@@ mit the performance of a system like this one is the number of pi@@ x@@ els on your screen at any given moment . it &apos;s also very flexi@@ ble architecture .
this is an entire book , so this is an example of non-@@ image data .
this is &quot; b@@ lea@@ k house &quot; by di@@ ck@@ ens . every colum@@ n is a chap@@ ter .
to prove to you that it &apos;s really text , and not an image , we can do something like so , to really show that this is a real repres@@ entation of the text ; it &apos;s not a picture .
maybe this is a kind of an artificial way to read an e-@@ book .
i wouldn &apos;t re@@ com@@ men@@ d it .
this is a more reali@@ stic case . this is an issue of the guar@@ di@@ an .
every large image is the beginning of a section .
and this really gives you the joy and the good experience of reading the real paper version of a magazine or a newspaper , which is an in@@ her@@ ently multi-@@ scale kind of medium .
we &apos;ve also done a little something with the corner of this particular issue of the guar@@ di@@ an .
we &apos;ve made up a fa@@ ke ad that &apos;s very high resol@@ ution -- much higher than you &apos;d be able to get in an ordinary ad -- and we &apos;ve em@@ bed@@ ded extra content .
if you want to see the fe@@ atures of this car , you can see it here .
or other models , or even technical speci@@ fi@@ cations .
and this really gets at some of these ideas about really doing away with those limit@@ s on screen real e@@ state .
we hope that this means no more po@@ p-@@ u@@ ps and other kind of ru@@ b@@ bis@@ h like that -- shouldn &apos;t be necessary .
of course , ma@@ pping is one of those really obvious appli@@ cations for a technology like this .
and this one i really won &apos;t spend any time on , except to say that we have things to contribu@@ te to this field as well .
but those are all the roads in the u.@@ s .
super@@ im@@ posed on top of a nasa ge@@ o@@ spa@@ tial image .
so let &apos;s pull up , now , something else .
this is actually live on the web now ; you can go check it out .
this is a project called photo@@ syn@@ th , which really mar@@ ries two different technologies .
one of them is se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on and the other is some very beautiful computer vision research done by no@@ ah sna@@ vely , a graduate student at the university of washington , co-@@ ad@@ vis@@ ed by steve sei@@ tz at u.@@ w .
and ri@@ ck s@@ ze@@ li@@ sk@@ i at microsoft research . a very nice collaboration .
and so this is live on the web . it &apos;s powered by se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on .
you can see that when we kind of do these sorts of vie@@ ws , where we can di@@ ve through images and have this kind of multi-@@ resol@@ ution experience .
but the spa@@ tial arr@@ ange@@ ment of the images here is actually meaning@@ ful .
the computer vision algorith@@ ms have regi@@ ster@@ ed these images together so that they cor@@ respond to the real space in which these sh@@ ots -- all taken near gras@@ s@@ i la@@ kes in the can@@ adi@@ an rock@@ ies -- all these sh@@ ots were taken . so you see elements here of stabili@@ zed sli@@ de-@@ show or pan@@ or@@ am@@ ic ima@@ ging , and these things have all been related spa@@ tially .
i &apos;m not sure if i have time to show you any other environments .
there are some that are much more spa@@ tial .
i would like to jump straight to one of no@@ ah &apos;s original dat@@ a-@@ sets -- and this is from an early prototyp@@ e of photo@@ syn@@ th that we first got working in the summer -- to show you what i think is really the pun@@ ch line behind this technology , the photo@@ syn@@ th technology . and it &apos;s not necessarily so appar@@ ent from looking at the environments that we &apos;ve put up on the website .
we had to worry about the law@@ yers and so on .
this is a re@@ construction of not@@ re d@@ ame ca@@ the@@ d@@ ral that was done entirely compu@@ ta@@ tion@@ ally from images sc@@ ra@@ ped from fli@@ ck@@ r . you just type not@@ re d@@ ame into fli@@ ck@@ r , and you get some pictures of guys in t-@@ shir@@ ts , and of the cam@@ pus and so on . and each of these orange con@@ es represents an image that was discovered to bel@@ ong to this model .
and so these are all fli@@ ck@@ r images , and they &apos;ve all been related spa@@ tially in this way .
and we can just navi@@ gate in this very simple way .
you know , i never thought that i &apos;d end up working at microsoft .
it &apos;s very gra@@ ti@@ fying to have this kind of re@@ ception here .
i guess you can see this is lots of different types of c@@ ameras : it &apos;s everything from cell phone c@@ ameras to professional sl@@ rs , quite a large number of them , stit@@ ched together in this environment .
and if i can , i &apos;ll find some of the sort of weird ones .
so many of them are oc@@ clu@@ ded by faces , and so on .
somewhere in here there are actually a series of photographs -- here we go .
this is actually a poster of not@@ re d@@ ame that regi@@ ster@@ ed cor@@ rec@@ tly .
we can di@@ ve in from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
what the point here really is is that we can do things with the social environment . this is now taking data from everybody -- from the entire collective memory of , visu@@ ally , of what the earth looks like -- and link all of that together .
all of those photos become lin@@ ked together , and they make something emer@@ gent that &apos;s greater than the sum of the parts .
you have a model that emer@@ ges of the entire earth .
think of this as the long tail to ste@@ phen law@@ ler &apos;s virtual earth work .
and this is something that gro@@ ws in complexity as people use it , and whose benefits become greater to the users as they use it .
their own photos are getting tag@@ ged with meta@@ -@@ data that somebody else enter@@ ed .
if somebody bo@@ ther@@ ed to tag all of these sa@@ in@@ ts and say who they all are , then my photo of not@@ re d@@ ame ca@@ the@@ d@@ ral suddenly gets en@@ rich@@ ed with all of that data , and i can use it as an ent@@ ry point to di@@ ve into that space , into that meta@@ -@@ verse , using everybody else &apos;s photos , and do a kind of a cros@@ s-@@ mod@@ al and cros@@ s-@@ user social experience that way .
and of course , a b@@ y-@@ product of all of that is im@@ men@@ sely rich virtual models of every interesting part of the earth , colle@@ cted not just from over@@ head fli@@ ghts and from satelli@@ te images and so on , but from the collective memory .
thank you so much .
do i understand this right ? that what your software is going to allow , is that at some point , really within the next few years , all the pictures that are shared by anyone across the world are going to basically link together ?
yes . what this is really doing is disco@@ vering .
it &apos;s creating hyper@@ links , if you will , between images .
and it &apos;s doing that based on the content inside the images .
and that gets really exciting when you think about the rich@@ ness of the se@@ man@@ tic information that a lot of those images have .
like when you do a web search for images , you type in phr@@ ases , and the text on the web page is carrying a lot of information about what that picture is of .
now , what if that picture links to all of your pictures ?
then the amount of se@@ man@@ tic inter@@ connection and the amount of rich@@ ness that comes out of that is really huge . it &apos;s a classi@@ c network effect .
bla@@ ise , that is truly incredible . con@@ gr@@ at@@ u@@ lations .
thanks so much .
i &apos;m going to talk to you about some stuff that &apos;s in this book of mine that i hope will res@@ on@@ ate with other things you &apos;ve already heard , and i &apos;ll try to make some connections myself , in case you miss them .
i want to start with what i call the &quot; offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma . &quot;
the offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma of what ?
the offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma of all western industrial societies .
and the offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma runs like this : if we are interested in ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ zing the wel@@ f@@ are of our citizens , the way to do that is to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze individual freedom .
the reason for this is both that freedom is in and of itself good , valuable , wor@@ th@@ while , essential to being human .
and because if people have freedom , then each of us can act on our own to do the things that will ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze our wel@@ f@@ are , and no one has to decide on our be@@ half .
the way to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze freedom is to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze choice .
the more choice people have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more wel@@ f@@ are they have .
this , i think , is so deeply em@@ bed@@ ded in the water supply that it wouldn &apos;t occu@@ r to anyone to question it .
and it &apos;s also deeply em@@ bed@@ ded in our lives .
i &apos;ll give you some examples of what modern progress has made possible for us .
this is my super@@ market . not such a big one .
i want to say just a word about sal@@ ad d@@ res@@ sing .
17@@ 5 sal@@ ad d@@ res@@ s@@ ings in my super@@ market , if you don &apos;t count the 10 extra@@ -@@ virg@@ in o@@ live o@@ ils and 12 bal@@ sam@@ ic vin@@ eg@@ ars you could buy to make a very large number of your own sal@@ ad d@@ res@@ s@@ ings , in the off@@ -@@ chance that none of the 17@@ 5 the store has on offer suit you .
so this is what the super@@ market is like .
and then you go to the consumer electr@@ on@@ ics store to set up a stere@@ o system -- speak@@ ers , c@@ d player , ta@@ pe player , tun@@ er , am@@ pli@@ fi@@ er -- and in this one single consumer electr@@ on@@ ics store , there are that many stere@@ o systems .
we can constru@@ ct si@@ x-@@ and-@@ a-@@ hal@@ f-@@ million different stere@@ o systems out of the components that are on offer in one store .
you &apos;ve got to ad@@ mit that &apos;s a lot of choice .
in other do@@ ma@@ ins -- the world of communic@@ ations .
there was a time , when i was a boy , when you could get any kind of tele@@ phone service you wanted , as long as it came from ma bell .
you r@@ ented your phone . you didn &apos;t buy it .
one con@@ sequence of that , by the way , is that the phone never broke .
and those days are gone .
we now have an almost un@@ limited variety of phones , especially in the world of cell phones .
these are cell phones of the future .
my favorite is the middle one -- the mp@@ 3 player , nose hair tri@@ mmer , and cre@@ me bru@@ lee tor@@ ch .
and if by some chance you haven &apos;t seen that in your store yet , you can rest assu@@ red that one day soon you will .
and what this does is it leads people to walk into their stor@@ es asking this question .
and do you know what the answer to this question now is ?
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
it is not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
so , in other aspe@@ cts of life that are much more significant than buying things , the same explosion of choice is true .
health care -- it is no longer the case in the united states that you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you , &quot; well , we could do a , or we could do b .
a has these benefits , and these risks .
b has these benefits , and these risks . what do you want to do ? &quot;
and you say , &quot; do@@ c , what should i do ? &quot;
and the do@@ c says , &quot; a has these benefits and risks , and b has these benefits and risks .
what do you want to do ? &quot;
and you say , &quot; if you were me , do@@ c , what would you do ? &quot;
and the do@@ c says , &quot; but i &apos;m not you . &quot;
and the result is -- we call it &quot; patient autonom@@ y , &quot; which makes it sound like a good thing , but what it really is is a shif@@ ting of the bur@@ den and the responsibility for decisi@@ on-@@ making from somebody who knows something -- nam@@ ely , the doctor -- to somebody who knows nothing and is almost certainly sick and th@@ us not in the best shape to be making decisions -- nam@@ ely , the patient .
there &apos;s enormous marketing of pres@@ cri@@ ption drugs to people like you and me , which , if you think about it , makes no sense at all , since we can &apos;t buy them .
why do they market to us if we can &apos;t buy them ?
the answer is that they expect us to call our doctors the next morning and ask for our pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tions to be changed .
something as dra@@ matic as our identity has now become a matter of choice , as this slide is meant to indi@@ cate .
we don &apos;t in@@ her@@ it an identity ; we get to inv@@ ent it .
and we get to re-@@ inv@@ ent ourselves as often as we like .
and that means that everyday , when you wake up in the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
with respect to marriage and family , there was a time when the de@@ fau@@ lt assu@@ mption that almost everyone had is that you got married as soon as you could , and then you started having kids as soon as you could .
the only real choice was who , not when , and not what you did after .
no@@ wa@@ days , everything is very much up for grab@@ s .
i teach wonder@@ fully intelligent students , and i as@@ sign 20 percent less work than i used to .
and it &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and it &apos;s not because they &apos;re less di@@ li@@ gent .
it &apos;s because they are pre@@ occu@@ pi@@ ed , asking themselves , &quot; should i get married or not ? should i get married now ?
should i get married later ? should i have kids first , or a career first ? &quot;
all of these are consum@@ ing questions .
and they &apos;re going to answer these questions , whether or not it means not doing all the work i as@@ sign and not getting a good grade in my cour@@ ses .
and indeed they should . these are important questions to answer .
work -- we are bl@@ essed , as car@@ l was poin@@ ting out , with the technology that en@@ ables us to work every minute of every day from any place on the planet -- except the rand@@ ol@@ ph hotel .
there is one corner , by the way , that i &apos;m not going to tell anybody about , where the wi@@ f@@ i works .
i &apos;m not telling you about it because i want to use it .
so what this means , this incredible freedom of choice we have with respect to work , is that we have to make a decision , again and again and again , about whether we should or shouldn &apos;t be working .
we can go to watch our kid play soc@@ cer , and we have our cell phone on one hi@@ p , and our black@@ ber@@ ry on our other hi@@ p , and our laptop , pres@@ u@@ ma@@ bly , on our la@@ ps .
and even if they &apos;re all shu@@ t off , every minute that we &apos;re watching our kid mu@@ ti@@ late a soc@@ cer game , we are also asking ourselves , &quot; should i answer this cell phone call ?
should i respond to this email ? should i dra@@ ft this letter ? &quot;
and even if the answer to the question is &quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s certainly going to make the experience of your kid &apos;s soc@@ cer game very different than it would &apos;ve been .
so everywhere we look , big things and small things , material things and lifest@@ yle things , life is a matter of choice .
and the world we used to live in looked like this .
that is to say , there were some choices , but not everything was a matter of choice .
and the world we now live in looks like this .
and the question is , is this good news , or bad news ?
and the answer is yes .
we all know what &apos;s good about it , so i &apos;m going to talk about what &apos;s bad about it .
all of this choice has two effects , two negative effects on people .
one effect , parado@@ x@@ ically , is that it produ@@ ces paraly@@ sis , rather than liber@@ ation .
with so many op@@ tions to choose from , people find it very difficult to choose at all .
i &apos;ll give you one very dra@@ matic example of this : a study that was done of invest@@ ments in volun@@ t@@ ary reti@@ re@@ ment plans .
a collea@@ gue of mine got access to investment recor@@ ds from van@@ gu@@ ard , the gigan@@ tic mu@@ tual fund company of about a million employees and about 2,000 different work@@ places .
and what she found is that for every 10 mu@@ tual fun@@ ds the emplo@@ yer off@@ ered , rate of participa@@ tion went down two percent .
you offer 50 fun@@ ds -- 10 percent fewer employees participa@@ te than if you only offer five . why ?
because with 50 fun@@ ds to choose from , it &apos;s so dam@@ n hard to decide which fund to choose that you &apos;ll just put it off until tomorrow .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and of course tomorrow never comes .
understand that not only does this mean that people are going to have to eat dog food when they reti@@ re because they don &apos;t have enough money put away , it also means that making the decision is so hard that they pass up significant mat@@ ching money from the emplo@@ yer .
by not partici@@ p@@ ating , they are pas@@ sing up as much as 5,000 dollars a year from the emplo@@ yer , who would happ@@ ily match their contribu@@ tion .
so paraly@@ sis is a con@@ sequence of having too many choices .
and i think it makes the world look like this .
you really want to get the decision right if it &apos;s for all e@@ ter@@ ni@@ ty , right ?
you don &apos;t want to pick the wrong mu@@ tual fund , or even the wrong sal@@ ad d@@ res@@ sing .
so that &apos;s one effect . the second effect is that even if we manage to over@@ come the paraly@@ sis and make a choice , we end up less satis@@ fied with the result of the choice than we would be if we had fewer op@@ tions to choose from .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is that with a lot of different sal@@ ad d@@ res@@ s@@ ings to choose from , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and , you know , what sal@@ ad d@@ res@@ sing is ? -- it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have made a different choice that would have been better . and what happens is this imag@@ ined alternative indu@@ ces you to re@@ gre@@ t the decision you made , and this re@@ gre@@ t sub@@ tra@@ cts from the satis@@ fac@@ tion you get out of the decision you made , even if it was a good decision .
the more op@@ tions there are , the easier it is to re@@ gre@@ t anything at all that is dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting about the option that you cho@@ se .
second , what econom@@ ists call &quot; opportunity costs . &quot;
dan gil@@ bert made a big point this morning of talking about how much the way in which we value things depen@@ ds on what we compare them to .
well , when there are lots of alterna@@ tives to consider , it is easy to imagine the attra@@ ctive fe@@ atures of alterna@@ tives that you re@@ je@@ ct , that make you less satis@@ fied with the alternative that you &apos;ve cho@@ sen .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who aren &apos;t new yor@@ kers , i apo@@ logi@@ ze .
but here &apos;s what you &apos;re supposed to be thinking .
here &apos;s this couple on the ham@@ p@@ tons .
very expensive real e@@ state .
gor@@ ge@@ ous beach . beautiful day . they have it all to themselves .
what could be better ? &quot; well , dam@@ n it , &quot; this guy is thinking , &quot; it &apos;s aug@@ ust .
everybody in my manhattan neighborhood is away .
i could be par@@ king right in front of my building . &quot;
and he sp@@ ends two weeks na@@ g@@ ged by the idea that he is missing the opportunity , day after day , to have a great par@@ king space .
opportunity costs sub@@ tra@@ ct from the satis@@ fac@@ tion we get out of what we choose , even when what we choose is terri@@ fic .
and the more op@@ tions there are to consider , the more attra@@ ctive fe@@ atures of these op@@ tions are going to be refle@@ cted by us as opportunity costs .
here &apos;s another example .
now this carto@@ on makes a lot of points .
it makes points about living in the moment as well , and probably about doing things slowly .
but one point it makes is that whenever you &apos;re choo@@ sing one thing , you &apos;re choo@@ sing not to do other things .
and those other things may have lots of attra@@ ctive fe@@ atures , and it &apos;s going to make what you &apos;re doing less attra@@ ctive .
third : es@@ cal@@ ation of expec@@ tations .
this hit me when i went to replace my je@@ ans .
i wear je@@ ans almost all the time .
and there was a time when je@@ ans came in one fla@@ vor , and you bought them , and they fit like cra@@ p , and they were incredibly un@@ comfortable , and if you wor@@ e them long enough and was@@ hed them enough times , they started to feel ok .
so i went to replace my je@@ ans after years and years of wearing these old ones , and i said , you know , &quot; i want a pair of je@@ ans . here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the sh@@ op@@ kee@@ per said , &quot; do you want sli@@ m fit , easy fit , rela@@ x@@ ed fit ?
you want butt@@ on fly or zi@@ pp@@ er fly ? you want st@@ one@@ was@@ hed or aci@@ d-@@ was@@ hed ?
do you want them dist@@ ressed ?
you want boot cut , you want ta@@ per@@ ed , bla@@ h bla@@ h bla@@ h ... &quot; on and on he went .
my ja@@ w dro@@ pped , and after i re@@ covered , i said , &quot; i want the kind that used to be the only kind . &quot;
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour trying on all these dam@@ n je@@ ans , and i walked out of the store -- truth ! -- with the be@@ st-@@ fit@@ ting je@@ ans i had ever had .
i did better . all this choice made it possible for me to do better .
but i felt worse .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to explain this to myself .
the reason i felt worse is that , with all of these op@@ tions available , my expec@@ tations about how good a pair of je@@ ans should be went up .
i had very low -- i had no particular expec@@ tations when they only came in one fla@@ vor .
when they came in 100 fla@@ vor@@ s , dam@@ n it , one of them should &apos;ve been perfect .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i compared what i got to what i expected , and what i got was dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting in compar@@ ison to what i expected .
ad@@ ding op@@ tions to people &apos;s lives can &apos;t help but increase the expec@@ tations people have about how good those op@@ tions will be .
and what that &apos;s going to produce is less satis@@ fac@@ tion with results , even when they &apos;re good results .
nobody in the world of marketing knows this , because if they did , you wouldn &apos;t all know what this was about .
the truth is more like this .
the reason that everything was better back when everything was worse is that when everything was worse , it was actually possible for people to have experiences that were a pleas@@ ant surprise .
no@@ wa@@ days , the world we live in -- we aff@@ lu@@ ent , industri@@ alized citizens , with perfe@@ ction the expec@@ tation -- the best you can ever hope for is that stuff is as good as you expect it to be .
you will never be pleas@@ antly surprised because your expec@@ tations , my expec@@ tations , have gone through the roof .
the secret to happiness -- this is what you all came for -- the secret to happiness is low expec@@ tations .
i want to say -- just a little auto@@ bi@@ ogra@@ phi@@ cal moment -- that i actually am married to a wife , and she &apos;s really quite wonderful .
i couldn &apos;t have done better . i didn &apos;t se@@ ttle .
but sett@@ ling isn &apos;t always such a bad thing .
finally , one con@@ sequence of buying a b@@ ad@@ -@@ fit@@ ting pair of je@@ ans when there is only one kind to buy is that when you are dis@@ satis@@ fied , and you ask why , who &apos;s responsible , the answer is clear : the world is responsible . what could you do ?
when there are hundreds of different sty@@ les of je@@ ans available , and you buy one that is dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting , and you ask why , who &apos;s responsible ?
it is equ@@ ally clear that the answer to the question is you .
you could have done better .
with a hundred different kinds of je@@ ans on display , there is no exc@@ use for failure .
and so when people make decisions , and even though the results of the decisions are good , they feel dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted about them ; they bl@@ ame themselves .
clinical depression has explo@@ ded in the industrial world in the last generation .
i believe a significant -- not the only , but a significant -- contribu@@ tor to this explosion of depression , and also su@@ i@@ cide , is that people have experiences that are dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting because their standards are so high , and then when they have to explain these experiences to themselves , they think they &apos;re at fau@@ lt .
and so the net result is that we do better in general , obje@@ c@@ tively , and we feel worse .
so let me re@@ mind you .
this is the offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma , the one that we all take to be true , and it &apos;s all fal@@ se . it is not true .
there &apos;s no question that some choice is better than none , but it doesn &apos;t follow from that that more choice is better than some choice .
there &apos;s some ma@@ gical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty confi@@ dent that we have long since passed the point where op@@ tions improve our wel@@ f@@ are .
now , as a policy matter -- i &apos;m almost done -- as a policy matter , the thing to think about is this : what en@@ ables all of this choice in industrial societies is material aff@@ lu@@ ence .
there are lots of places in the world , and we have heard about several of them , where their problem is not that they have too much choice .
their problem is that they have too little .
so the stuff i &apos;m talking about is the pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar problem of modern , aff@@ lu@@ ent , western societies .
and what is so fru@@ str@@ ating and in@@ fu@@ ri@@ ating is this : steve le@@ vi@@ tt talked to you yesterday about how these expensive and diffic@@ ul@@ t-@@ to-@@ inst@@ all child se@@ ats don &apos;t help . it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated choices -- it &apos;s not simply that they don &apos;t help .
they actually hurt .
they actually make us worse off .
if some of what en@@ ables people in our societies to make all of the choices we make were shif@@ ted to societies in which people have too few op@@ tions , not only would those people &apos;s lives be impro@@ ved , but ours would be impro@@ ved also .
this is what econom@@ ists call a &quot; par@@ e@@ to-@@ impro@@ ving move . &quot;
income re@@ distribution will make everyone better off -- not just poor people -- because of how all this ex@@ cess choice pla@@ gues us .
so to conclu@@ de . you &apos;re supposed to read this carto@@ on , and , being a sophisti@@ cated person , say , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ?
you know , nothing is possible in this fis@@ h@@ bow@@ l . &quot;
im@@ pover@@ ished imagination , a m@@ yo@@ pi@@ c view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i read it at first .
the more i thought about it , however , the more i came to the view that this fish knows something .
because the truth of the matter is that if you sh@@ at@@ ter the fis@@ h@@ bow@@ l so that everything is possible , you don &apos;t have freedom . you have paraly@@ sis .
if you sh@@ at@@ ter this fis@@ h@@ bow@@ l so that everything is possible , you de@@ cre@@ ase satis@@ fac@@ tion .
you increase paraly@@ sis , and you de@@ cre@@ ase satis@@ fac@@ tion .
everybody needs a fis@@ h@@ bow@@ l .
this one is almost certainly too limited -- perhaps even for the fish , certainly for us .
but the ab@@ sen@@ ce of some metaph@@ or@@ ical fis@@ h@@ bow@@ l is a reci@@ pe for mis@@ ery , and , i sus@@ pe@@ ct , disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects before -- about the human genome and what that might mean , and disco@@ vering new sets of genes .
we &apos;re actually starting at a new point : we &apos;ve been di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zing biology , and now we &apos;re trying to go from that digital code into a new phase of biology with designing and syn@@ thes@@ i@@ zing life .
so , we &apos;ve always been trying to ask big questions .
&quot; what is life ? &quot; is something that i think many bi@@ ologists have been trying to understand at various levels .
we &apos;ve tried various approach@@ es , par@@ ing it down to mini@@ mal components .
we &apos;ve been di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zing it now for almost 20 years ; when we sequen@@ ced the human genome , it was going from the anal@@ o@@ g world of biology into the digital world of the computer .
now we &apos;re trying to ask , &quot; can we re@@ generate life or can we create new life out of this digital universe ? &quot;
this is the map of a small organis@@ m , my@@ cop@@ las@@ ma gen@@ itali@@ um , that has the small@@ est genome for a species that can self-@@ repli@@ cate in the laboratory , and we &apos;ve been trying to just see if we can come up with an even smaller genome .
we &apos;re able to kno@@ ck out on the order of 100 genes out of the 500 or so that are here .
when we look at its me@@ tab@@ oli@@ c map , it &apos;s relatively simple compared to ours -- trust me , this is simple -- but when we look at all the genes that we can kno@@ ck out one at a time , it &apos;s very un@@ likely that this would y@@ i@@ el@@ d a living cell .
so we decided the only way forward was to actually syn@@ thes@@ ize this chromo@@ some so we could v@@ ary the components to ask some of these most fundamental questions .
and so we started down the road of : can we syn@@ thes@@ ize a chromo@@ some ?
can chemistry per@@ mit making these really large molecules where we &apos;ve never been before ?
and if we do , can we boot up a chromo@@ some ?
a chromo@@ some , by the way , is just a piece of in@@ ert chemical material .
so , our p@@ ace of di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zing life has been increasing at an exponenti@@ al p@@ ace .
our ability to write the genetic code has been moving pretty slowly but has been increasing , and our lat@@ est point would put it on , now , an exponenti@@ al cur@@ ve .
we started this over 15 years ago .
it took several st@@ ages , in fact , starting with a bio@@ eth@@ ical re@@ view before we did the first experiments .
but it turns out syn@@ thes@@ i@@ zing dna is very difficult .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that make small pieces of dna -- 30 to 50 letters in l@@ ength -- and it &apos;s a de@@ generate process , so the longer you make the piece , the more er@@ r@@ ors there are .
so we had to create a new method for putting these little pieces together and cor@@ rect all the er@@ r@@ ors .
and this was our first attemp@@ t , starting with the digital information of the genome of ph@@ i x@@ 17@@ 4 .
it &apos;s a small virus that kill@@ s bacteria .
we designed the pieces , went through our er@@ ror cor@@ rec@@ tion and had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of in@@ ert chemical and put it in the bacteria , and the bacteria started to read this genetic code , made the vi@@ ral particles .
the vi@@ ral particles then were rele@@ ased from the cells and came back and killed the e@@ . col@@ i .
i was talking to the oil industry recently and i said they clearly understood that model .
they laugh@@ ed more than you guys are .
and so , we think this is a situation where the software can actually build its own hard@@ ware in a biological system .
but we wanted to go much larger : we wanted to build the entire bacteri@@ al chromo@@ some -- it &apos;s over 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 letters of genetic code -- so we thought we &apos;d build them in c@@ asse@@ tt@@ es the size of the viruses so we could actually v@@ ary the c@@ asse@@ tt@@ es to understand what the actual components of a living cell are .
design is critical , and if you &apos;re starting with digital information in the computer , that digital information has to be really accu@@ rate .
when we first sequen@@ ced this genome in 199@@ 5 , the standard of accu@@ ra@@ cy was one er@@ ror per 10,000 base pa@@ irs .
we actually found , on res@@ equ@@ en@@ cing it , 30 er@@ r@@ ors ; had we used that original sequence , it never would have been able to be bo@@ ot@@ ed up .
part of the design is designing pieces that are 50 letters long that have to over@@ la@@ p with all the other 5@@ 0-@@ letter pieces to build smaller sub@@ un@@ its we have to design so they can go together .
we design unique elements into this .
you may have read that we put water@@ mar@@ ks in .
think of this : we have a four@@ -@@ letter genetic code -- a , c , g and t .
tri@@ ple@@ ts of those letters code for roughly 20 amin@@ o aci@@ ds , such that there &apos;s a single letter desig@@ nation for each of the amin@@ o aci@@ ds .
so we can use the genetic code to write out words , sent@@ ences , thoughts .
ini@@ tially , all we did was auto@@ graph it .
some people were dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted there was not poetry .
we designed these pieces so we can just che@@ w back with enzy@@ mes ; there are enzy@@ mes that re@@ pair them and put them together .
and we started making pieces , starting with pieces that were 5,000 to 7@@ ,000 letters , put those together to make 24@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ letter pieces , then put sets of those going up to 7@@ 2,000 .
at each stage , we grew up these pieces in ab@@ und@@ ance so we could sequence them because we &apos;re trying to create a process that &apos;s extremely rob@@ ust that you can see in a minute .
we &apos;re trying to get to the point of auto@@ ma@@ tion .
so , this looks like a bas@@ ket@@ ball pla@@ yo@@ ff .
when we get into these really large pieces over 100,000 base pa@@ irs , they won &apos;t any longer grow re@@ adi@@ ly in e@@ . col@@ i -- it ex@@ hau@@ sts all the modern tools of molecular biology -- and so we turned to other mechanis@@ ms .
we knew there &apos;s a mechan@@ ism called hom@@ olog@@ ous re@@ combin@@ ation that biology uses to re@@ pair dna that can put pieces together .
here &apos;s an example of it : there &apos;s an organis@@ m called d@@ ein@@ o@@ co@@ c@@ c@@ us radi@@ o@@ dur@@ ans that can take three millions ra@@ ds of radiation .
you can see in the top pan@@ el , its chromo@@ some just gets blo@@ wn apart .
t@@ wel@@ ve to 24 hours later , it put it back together exactly as it was before .
we have thousands of organisms that can do this .
these organisms can be totally des@@ ic@@ cated ; they can live in a vac@@ u@@ um .
i am absolutely certain that life can exist in ou@@ ter space , move around , find a new a@@ que@@ ous environment .
in fact , nasa has shown a lot of this is out there .
here &apos;s an actual micro@@ graph of the molecule we built using these processes , actually just using ye@@ ast mechanis@@ ms with the right design of the pieces we put them in ; ye@@ ast puts them together auto@@ matically .
this is not an electr@@ on micro@@ graph ; this is just a regular phot@@ om@@ ic@@ ro@@ graph .
it &apos;s such a large molecule we can see it with a light microscop@@ e .
these are pictures over about a si@@ x-@@ second period .
so , this is the publi@@ cation we had just a short while ago .
this is over 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 letters of genetic code ; it &apos;s the largest molecule ever made by humans of a defined structure .
it &apos;s over 300 million molecular weight .
if we prin@@ ted it out at a 10 f@@ on@@ t with no spac@@ ing , it takes 14@@ 2 pages just to print this genetic code .
well , how do we boot up a chromo@@ some ? how do we activ@@ ate this ?
obviously , with a virus it &apos;s pretty simple ; it &apos;s much more complicated dealing with bacteria .
it &apos;s also simpl@@ er when you go into eu@@ kar@@ y@@ ot@@ es like ourselves : you can just pop out the nu@@ cle@@ us and pop in another one , and that &apos;s what you &apos;ve all heard about with c@@ lon@@ ing .
with bacteria and arch@@ a@@ e@@ a , the chromo@@ some is integr@@ ated into the cell , but we recently showed that we can do a complete transp@@ l@@ ant of a chromo@@ some from one cell to another and activ@@ ate it .
we pu@@ ri@@ fied a chromo@@ some from one micro@@ bi@@ al species -- roughly , these two are as dist@@ ant as human and mi@@ ce -- we ad@@ ded a few extra genes so we could sele@@ ct for this chromo@@ some , we di@@ gest@@ ed it with enzy@@ mes to kill all the proteins , and it was pretty stun@@ ning when we put this in the cell -- and you &apos;ll appreci@@ ate our very sophisti@@ cated graphi@@ cs here .
the new chromo@@ some went into the cell .
in fact , we thought this might be as far as it went , but we tried to design the process a little bit further .
this is a major mechan@@ ism of evolution right here .
we find all kinds of species that have taken up a second chromo@@ some or a third one from somewhere , ad@@ ding thousands of new tra@@ its in a second to that species .
so , people who think of evolution as just one gene changing at a time have mis@@ sed much of biology .
there are enzy@@ mes called restri@@ ction enzy@@ mes that actually di@@ gest dna .
the chromo@@ some that was in the cell doesn &apos;t have one ; the chromo@@ some we put in does .
it got expres@@ sed and it recogni@@ zed the other chromo@@ some as foreign material , che@@ wed it up , and so we ended up just with a cell with the new chromo@@ some .
it turned blue because of the genes we put in it .
and with a very short period of time , all the characteri@@ stics of one species were lost and it conver@@ ted totally into the new species based on the new software that we put in the cell .
all the proteins changed , the mem@@ bran@@ es changed ; when we read the genetic code , it &apos;s exactly what we had trans@@ fer@@ red in .
so , this may sound like genom@@ ic al@@ che@@ my , but we can , by moving the software of dna around , change things quite dra@@ matically .
now i &apos;ve argu@@ ed , this is not gen@@ es@@ is ; this is building on three and a half billion years of evolution .
and i &apos;ve argu@@ ed that we &apos;re about to perhaps create a new version of the cam@@ brian explosion , where there &apos;s massive new speci@@ ation based on this digital design .
why do this ?
i think this is pretty obvious in terms of some of the needs .
we &apos;re about to go from six and a half to nine billion people over the next 40 years .
to put it in context for myself : i was born in 194@@ 6 .
there are now three people on the planet for every one of us that exi@@ sted in 194@@ 6 ; within 40 years , there &apos;ll be four .
we have trouble fe@@ eding , provi@@ ding fresh , clean water , medi@@ cin@@ es , fuel for the six and a half billion .
it &apos;s going to be a stre@@ tch to do it for nine .
we use over five billion tons of coal , 30 billi@@ on-@@ plus bar@@ rel@@ s of oil -- that &apos;s a hundred million bar@@ rel@@ s a day .
when we try to think of biological processes or any process to replace that , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
then of course , there &apos;s all that co2 from this material that ends up in the atmosphere .
we now , from our discovery around the world , have a dat@@ ab@@ ase with about 20 million genes , and i like to think of these as the design components of the future .
the electr@@ on@@ ics industry only had a do@@ zen or so components , and look at the diversity that came out of that .
we &apos;re limited here pri@@ mar@@ ily by a biological reality and our imagination .
we now have techniques , because of these ra@@ pid metho@@ ds of syn@@ thesis , to do what we &apos;re calling combin@@ at@@ ori@@ al genom@@ ics .
we have the ability now to build a large robot that can make a million chromo@@ som@@ es a day .
when you think of process@@ ing these 20 million different genes or trying to optimi@@ ze processes to produce oc@@ tan@@ e or to produce pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tic@@ als , new vac@@ cin@@ es , we can just with a small team , do more molecular biology than the last 20 years of all science .
and it &apos;s just standard sele@@ ction : we can sele@@ ct for vi@@ ability , chemical or fuel production , v@@ acc@@ ine production , etc .
this is a screen s@@ nap@@ shot of some true design software that we &apos;re working on to actually be able to sit down and design species in the computer .
you know , we don &apos;t know necessarily what it &apos;ll look like : we know exactly what their genetic code looks like .
we &apos;re foc@@ using on now four@@ th-@@ generation fu@@ els .
