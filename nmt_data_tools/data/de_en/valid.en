what do you do when you have this sort of dis@@ rup@@ ted flow ?
ste@@ phen pal@@ um@@ bi : following the mer@@ cur@@ y tra@@ il
i really thought they were so bene@@ ath me .
but we didn &apos;t realize at the time that we actually needed a third mani@@ pul@@ ator , because we couldn &apos;t manipu@@ late the ne@@ ck from inside and walk the horse at the same time .
and now we would like to introdu@@ ce you to jo@@ ey .
b@@ j : and mi@@ key also has , in his fing@@ ers , the ability to move the tail from left to right , and up and down with the other hand .
mi@@ key bre@@ tt , cra@@ ig , le@@ o , z@@ em jo@@ a@@ qu@@ in and bas@@ il and me .
in winter , there &apos;s a lot of sle@@ eping going on ; you enjoy your family life inside .
the thing to watch for as a global phil@@ anth@@ rop@@ y industry comes about -- and that &apos;s exactly what is happening -- is how the as@@ pi@@ ration is to fli@@ p these old assu@@ mp@@ tions , for phil@@ anth@@ rop@@ y to become open and big and fast and connected , in service of the long term .
now , all of these big things for love -- experiments -- aren &apos;t going to take off .
i &apos;m going to look quickly at the fourth and fif@@ th categ@@ ories , which are innovation , competi@@ tions and social invest@@ ing .
it may be that the social sing@@ ul@@ ar@@ ity ahead is the one that we fear the most : a conver@@ gen@@ ce of cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es , of environmental de@@ gra@@ dation , of weapons of mass destruction , of pan@@ de@@ mi@@ cs , of poverty .
i believe that there are new , hidden ten@@ sions that are actually happening between people and institutions -- institutions that are the institutions that people in@@ hab@@ it in their daily life : schools , hospitals , work@@ places , fac@@ tor@@ ies , off@@ ices , etc .
the first gentle@@ man , he &apos;s a bak@@ er .
so , think of the three sett@@ ings i &apos;ve talked to you about : factory , migra@@ tion , office .
they were living on top of the work@@ sh@@ ops where they were working .
so , how many of you have ever gotten behind the whe@@ el of a car when you really shouldn &apos;t have been driving ?
one of the things that we &apos;ve developed in the lab -- we &apos;ve developed several vehi@@ cles -- is what we believe is the world &apos;s first autonom@@ ously dri@@ f@@ ting car .
now , clearly we &apos;re not going to put a couple of electro@@ des on his head and understand exactly what all of his thoughts are on the track .
watch the mental work@@ load , and watch the ste@@ ering .
so today , i &apos;m going to tell you about some people who didn &apos;t move out of their neighbor@@ ho@@ ods .
so a few years ago , l@@ .@@ a. coun@@ ty decided that they needed to spend 2.@@ 5 billion dollars to re@@ pair the city schools .
i mean , literally , her home@@ town is called whit@@ es@@ ville , west virg@@ ini@@ a .
so these three guys all understand how to produ@@ c@@ tively chan@@ nel dollars through our local econom@@ ies to meet exi@@ sting market dem@@ ands , reduce the social problems that we have now and prevent new problems in the future .
our m@@ uni@@ ci@@ p@@ ali@@ ties , rural and urban , play the oper@@ a@@ tional course of infrastructure -- things like waste dis@@ pos@@ al , energy demand , as well as social costs of un@@ emplo@@ y@@ ment , dro@@ p-@@ out rates , in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation rates and the im@@ pac@@ ts of various public health costs .
and reading that book made me re@@ exam@@ ine that theory because i need to explain what i mean by that .
and i think because early on , frank@@ ly , my programs were just a little bit ahead of their time .
and my question is , how did we get from there to here ?
i went to dea@@ f clu@@ bs .
and yet , we have nobody who is trying to en@@ sure that the next generation of children born to afri@@ can@@ -@@ americans and asi@@ ans come out with cre@@ am@@ y skin and yellow hair .
and he ended up achie@@ ving at a level that had never before been con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ated by any member of his family .
the experience of down syndro@@ me people inclu@@ des those who are ac@@ tors , those who are wri@@ ters , some who are able to live fully indepen@@ d@@ ently in adul@@ tho@@ od .
and a lot of the time the question of par@@ en@@ tho@@ od is , what do we v@@ ali@@ date in our children , and what do we cure in them ?
and ultimately i feel that in the same way that we test fl@@ am@@ e-@@ re@@ tar@@ d@@ ant pa@@ jam@@ as in an in@@ fer@@ no to en@@ sure they won &apos;t catch fire when our child reach@@ es across the sto@@ ve , so these stories of families negoti@@ ating these extreme differences refle@@ ct on the universal experience of par@@ enting , which is always that sometimes you look at your child and you think , where did you come from ?
and he had a very large head , which she thought might indi@@ cate hydro@@ cep@@ hal@@ us .
and i came from a very privi@@ le@@ ged background . i was very lucky .
never shown this picture before , and probably going to be su@@ ed for it .
the point being , this is going to be very , very inten@@ sive on the progra@@ mming side .
you want a separate thing , like the a@@ c adap@@ tor .
if you &apos;re in a desert , they can talk to each other about two kilometers apart .
not something you &apos;d en@@ vy or want to do .
and it &apos;s not to go out and buy 100 or 1,000 , though , i invi@@ te you to do that , and 10,000 would be even better .
and there are days -- i don &apos;t know about the rest of you guys -- but there are days when i pal@@ p@@ ably feel how much i rely on other people for pretty much everything in my life .
so actually now on this website , we have 18@@ ,000 people .
and we &apos;re building upon innova@@ tions of generations who went before us .
but remember , gre@@ e@@ ce is there today .
and when you think about the economy through these two different len@@ ses , you understand why this crisis is so hard to solve , because the worse the crisis gets , the higher the sta@@ kes are , the more each side thinks they know the answer and the other side is just going to ru@@ in everything .
that &apos;s 20 percent of the budget , and that pres@@ ents a more difficult issue .
the phr@@ ase that you want , if you &apos;re a graduate student or a post@@ do@@ c or you &apos;re a professor , a 3@@ 8@@ -year-old economics professor , is , &quot; i &apos;m an em@@ pi@@ ri@@ c@@ ist .
we know what it &apos;s like to have these people on tv , in con@@ gress , y@@ elling about how the end of the world is coming if we don &apos;t adop@@ t their view completely , because it &apos;s happened about the dollar ever since there &apos;s been a dollar .
and he said to the guy , &quot; why have you put stuff on the back that no one will ever see ? &quot;
i thought , well that &apos;s not good enough .
the wir@@ ing from your sensor@@ y appar@@ at@@ us to those bits is shor@@ ter than the bits that have to pass through the thin@@ ky bit , the cortex .
where are you feeling this ?
and also tri@@ um@@ ph , this sense of tran@@ scen@@ dence , this &quot; i never knew that . ah , this is something new . &quot;
so i &apos;m going to sh@@ am@@ el@@ ess@@ ly ex@@ pose something to you , which is beautiful to me .
and then i can &apos;t tell you how hard it is to do that radi@@ ator , which is cur@@ ved .
no one &apos;s going to notice those spli@@ t lines and changes .
but what i have to do now , feeling again , what i &apos;ve got to do is to be able to supply enough of these enzy@@ mes , of these tri@@ g@@ gers into something early on in the process , that you pick it up , not through your thinking , but through your feeling .
no time . it says i have two minutes left , so we can &apos;t do this .
now i think it &apos;s too easy .
we have se@@ cul@@ ari@@ zed b@@ ad@@ ly , i would argue .
we need data , we don &apos;t need help .
you need to keep repe@@ ating the lesson 10 times a day .
this comes across also in the way in which religi@@ ons set up ritu@@ als around important feelings .
and when they teach us a lesson , they do it via the body .
but that feeling of puzz@@ le@@ ment is struc@@ tural to con@@ temporary art .
the people in the modern world , in the se@@ cular world , who are interested in matters of the spirit , in matters of the mind , in higher sou@@ l-@@ like concern@@ s , tend to be isol@@ ated individuals .
if you want to change the world , you have to group together , you have to be collabor@@ ative .
and i say , &quot; of course . &quot; and they say , &quot; so aren &apos;t you sort of religious ? &quot;
because you &apos;ve agre@@ ed on 90 percent of things , because you have a shared view on so many things , and you poli@@ tely diff@@ er .
so it took me from places like chi@@ le -- the at@@ ac@@ ama desert in chi@@ le -- to si@@ ber@@ ia , to under@@ ground min@@ es in the japanese al@@ ps , in northern america , all the way to ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a and even to the south pole .
you need something like tens of me@@ gat@@ ons of water -- almost a gi@@ gat@@ on of water -- in order to have any chance of cat@@ ching this neu@@ trin@@ o .
the toi@@ lets there are literally holes in the ground covered with a woo@@ den sha@@ ck .
so this is us land@@ ing on the ross ice shel@@ f in ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a .
the fabri@@ c alone wei@@ gh@@ s two tons .
an@@ il an@@ anth@@ as@@ w@@ am@@ y : what it takes to do extreme astro@@ physics
well , first you have to , as an engineer , scop@@ e the problem . how big is it ?
and a boo@@ k@@ mobile -- the size of a van with a satelli@@ te dis@@ h , a prin@@ ter , bin@@ der and cu@@ tter , and kids make their own books .
we have one of these things now . it &apos;s completely cool .
but we sent -- thought , ok , if we &apos;re going to need to do this , let &apos;s do it in-@@ library .
the ge@@ tty here is moving their books to the u@@ cl@@ a , which is where we have one these scan@@ ning centers , and scan@@ ning their out@@ -@@ of-@@ copy@@ right books , which is fab@@ ul@@ ous .
it costs about 10 dollars a piece to go and take a dis@@ k and put it online , if you &apos;re doing things in volu@@ me .
we ten@@ ded towards lon@@ ger@@ -@@ term things and also things that people can re@@ use and make into new movies , which has just been great fun .
so anyway , you &apos;ve got basically an idea of where things came from .
so en@@ vision what it looks like all wra@@ pped up .
it looked more like this when it was all wra@@ pped up -- not quite so pretty .
and frank@@ ly , i face a big ob@@ stac@@ le .
but these are essentially ex@@ tern@@ alized sto@@ ma@@ chs and l@@ ung@@ s .
so , f@@ ung@@ i and my@@ ce@@ li@@ um sequ@@ e@@ ster carbon dio@@ xide in the form of cal@@ ci@@ um ox@@ al@@ ates .
the my@@ ce@@ li@@ um , in the right conditions , produ@@ ces a mush@@ room -- it bur@@ sts through with such fer@@ o@@ city that it can break as@@ p@@ halt .
and i &apos;ll show you a graph here .
there &apos;s a v@@ et@@ ted press rele@@ ase that you can read -- it &apos;s v@@ et@@ ted by do@@ d -- if you google &quot; stam@@ ets &quot; and &quot; small@@ po@@ x . &quot;
so , the house is no longer su@@ it@@ able for invasi@@ on .
too many with@@ dra@@ w@@ als from the carbon bank , and so this population will be shu@@ t down .
so we had our own mini@@ ature rain@@ forest , a private beach with a coral re@@ e@@ f .
so eight of us went in : four men and four women .
we stopped ir@@ ri@@ g@@ ating our soil , as much as we could .
but on the other hand , it was the scientific gold of the project , because we could really cr@@ ank this baby up , as a scientific tool , and see if we could , in fact , find where those seven tons of oxygen had gone .
i had been growing all my own food .
and all of it was coming from this : sh@@ ri@@ mp far@@ ms .
it &apos;s such a huge subject . &quot;
and if you lose where you are in your bio@@ sphere , or are perhaps having a diffic@@ ul@@ ty conne@@ cting with where you are in the bio@@ sphere , i would say to you , take a deep breath .
the cause of our trou@@ bles is actually the complexity that science has given us .
we have now found treat@@ ments for nearly all of the tens of thousands of conditions that a human being can have .
there &apos;s another sign that we need p@@ it cre@@ ws , and that &apos;s the un@@ mana@@ ge@@ able cost of our care .
sk@@ ill number one is the ability to recognize success and the ability to recognize failure .
we got the lead safety engineer for bo@@ eing to help us .
there &apos;s a deep resi@@ stance because using these tools forces us to con@@ front that we &apos;re not a system , forces us to be@@ have with a different set of values .
and most of those los@@ ses are because of things we know .
if you don &apos;t just want a queen , you can buy , actually , a three-@@ po@@ und pac@@ ka@@ ge of bees , which comes in the mail , and of course , the post@@ al office is always very concerned when they get , you know , your three-@@ po@@ und pac@@ k@@ ages of bees .
but if you &apos;re losing 50 percent to 80 percent of your col@@ on@@ ies , you can &apos;t survive three years in a row . and we &apos;re really worried about losing this se@@ gment of our industry .
and bees are very fa@@ i@@ th@@ ful .
and of course , bees are not the only important factor here .
but i also want to rein@@ force some of the ideas we &apos;ve heard here , because having a me@@ a@@ dow or living by a me@@ a@@ dow is transforma@@ tional .
well actually , i &apos;ve &#91; been &#93; whi@@ st@@ ling since the age of four , about four .
i lost my face .
and i want to first re@@ he@@ ar@@ se with you your whi@@ st@@ ling .
some of them are very easy .
and they also are able to show and to exhi@@ bit such a wonderful and complex behavior that can be described just with the term of intelligence .
look at this young be@@ an that is moving to catch the light every time .
how is it possible to do this without a brain ?
and why are they so similar ?
thank you .
they &apos;re going to be enter@@ ing this car one by one .
and also in 50 other cities around the world , people partici@@ p@@ ated .
and because it was in union square park , right by a sub@@ way station , there were hundreds of people by the end who stopped and looked up and watched what we were doing .
they &apos;re wearing either a yellow shir@@ t or a black shir@@ t .
he gave 2,000 high fi@@ ves that day , and he was@@ hed his hands before and after@@ ward and did not get sick .
and not knowing where help was needed always en@@ su@@ red that help was in short supply in the areas that needed it most .
our goal over the next year is to get water can@@ ary ready for the field and to open-@@ source the hard@@ ware so that anyone can contribu@@ te to the development and the ev@@ al@@ u@@ ation , so we can t@@ ack@@ le this problem together .
now why am i talking about co@@ ws ?
so what i &apos;m pro@@ pos@@ ing is , just as we require reading , writing , ari@@ th@@ me@@ tic , american history , so we should have a cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um on facts about all the religi@@ ons of the world -- about their history , about their cre@@ e@@ ds , about their tex@@ ts , their music , their symbo@@ li@@ sms , their pro@@ hi@@ bi@@ tions , their requi@@ re@@ ments .
all i &apos;m saying is -- facts . facts only .
except , of course , it wasn &apos;t the she@@ ep &apos;s cle@@ vern@@ ess .
the lesson we learn from this is you don &apos;t have to have a mind to be a bene@@ fi@@ ci@@ ary .
and how can we do that ?
i &apos;m talking also about chri@@ sti@@ an@@ ity .
yes .
but i wish it were better .
and here i think , &quot; wait a minute . &quot;
well , this from &quot; the purpose driven life &quot; -- &quot; the bi@@ ble must become the auth@@ or@@ it@@ ative standard for my life , the comp@@ ass i rely on for direction , the coun@@ sel i listen to for making wise decisions and the ben@@ ch@@ mark i use for ev@@ al@@ u@@ ating everything . &quot;
now do we really want to com@@ mit ourselves to eng@@ ul@@ fing all the other religi@@ ons when their hol@@ y books are telling them , &quot; don &apos;t listen to the other side , that &apos;s just sat@@ an talking ! &quot;
e@@ ars are made not for hearing , but for listening .
it looks a bit like this .
if you can &apos;t hear somebody talking to you in a l@@ oud voice , it &apos;s too l@@ oud .
first of all , listen consci@@ ously .
and my relationship to especially human@@ -@@ made objects which someone else said they work like this , well , i can say they work a different way , a little bit .
so kids don &apos;t have as hard of a time with this , and i saw in my own son , i gave him this book .
and then you can take the little piano circu@@ it off the pen@@ cil .
and so we &apos;re like , &quot; we got@@ ta put a video out about this . &quot;
okay , just wait for this one . this is good .
it &apos;s really going to be seven billion pa@@ irs of hands , each following their own passi@@ ons , and each kind of like a mo@@ sa@@ ic coming up and creating this world in their back@@ y@@ ards and in their kit@@ ch@@ ens .
but they won &apos;t come to us directly through light .
but einstein always thought black holes were a mathematical od@@ di@@ ty .
it would be bad if we tried to fire our rock@@ ets and get out of there because we couldn &apos;t , anymore than light can es@@ cape .
this is from my group -- a slightly less glam@@ or@@ ous computer mod@@ el@@ ing .
and sur@@ ely , somewhere in the universe two black holes have mer@@ ged .
galaxies form , and generations of stars form in those galaxies , and around one star , at least one star , is a habit@@ able planet .
so we have to wonder , if there is a multi@@ verse , in some other pat@@ ch of that multi@@ verse , are there creatures ?
of the 100 in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated people that are rele@@ ased , 60 will return to prison .
well , it has its pl@@ uses and min@@ uses .
from the fact that they are only ser@@ ving one audience , main@@ ly the western culture .
i go everywhere to make believe it &apos;s iran .
now comes the green movement -- the summer of 2009 , as my film is rele@@ ased -- the u@@ pris@@ ing begins in the streets of te@@ hr@@ an .
it can &apos;t afford to dou@@ bt the person who ten@@ ds the child .
one person w@@ ins .
i will come to it later .
you cannot comm@@ and compassion unless you become limit@@ less , and nobody can become limit@@ less , either you are or you are not . period .
you act com@@ passion@@ ately .
if this does not b@@ low your mind , then you have no emotion .
and let &apos;s pause here .
it &apos;s good for motiv@@ ated students .
in a traditional classroom , you have a couple of home@@ work , home@@ work , lec@@ ture , home@@ work , lec@@ ture , and then you have a s@@ nap@@ shot ex@@ am .
and you can go to the site right now . it &apos;s all free . not trying to sell anything .
red means they &apos;re stuck .
and we &apos;re seeing it over and over and over again .
i &apos;m still doing all the videos , but we have a rock@@ star team doing the software .
and they &apos;re literally saying , &quot; hey , this is nice , but ... &quot; like that focus graph , a lot of the teachers said , &quot; i have a feeling that a lot of the kids are jum@@ ping around and not foc@@ using on one top@@ ic . &quot;
but there are also hallu@@ cin@@ ations as well , and hallu@@ cin@@ ations are completely different .
i see a lot of children . they are walking up and down sta@@ irs .
i said , &quot; there is a special form of visual hallu@@ cin@@ ation which may go with de@@ teri@@ or@@ ating vision or blin@@ dness .
the first thing he said was he saw a hand@@ ker@@ ch@@ ie@@ f in mi@@ da@@ ir .
and he turned around . and then he divi@@ ded into six fig@@ ures in stri@@ ped shir@@ ts , who started walking towards her .
but no more than one percent of the people ac@@ knowledge them , because they are afraid they will be seen as in@@ san@@ e or something .
when people have these simple ge@@ om@@ et@@ ri@@ cal hallu@@ cin@@ ations , the primary visual cortex is activ@@ ated .
it is only if one is visu@@ ally im@@ pa@@ i@@ red or blind that the process is inter@@ rup@@ ted .
and actually i &apos;m a little visu@@ ally im@@ pa@@ i@@ red myself .
but i would come back from those di@@ ves and try to share the experience with words , and they were totally in@@ ade@@ qu@@ ate to the task .
it &apos;s un@@ belie@@ vable .
this looks like something out of a dr. se@@ uss book -- just all man@@ ner of creatures all over this thing .
and we view it with a camera system i developed called e@@ ye@@ -@@ in-@@ the-@@ sea that uses far red light that &apos;s invisible to most animals , so it &apos;s un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive .
and it does actually seem to be trying to eat the electr@@ onic j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish .
edi@@ th wid@@ der : the weird , wonderful world of bi@@ ol@@ umines@@ c@@ ence
the yel@@ low-@@ green area is the flu@@ ids of blood , which is mostly water , but it &apos;s also anti@@ bodies , sug@@ ars , hor@@ mon@@ es , that kind of thing .
it &apos;s an accu@@ rate repres@@ entation , and it &apos;s pretty much at the cor@@ rect speed for what is oc@@ curr@@ ing inside you .
one set of dna goes to one side , the other side gets the other set of dna -- iden@@ tical cop@@ ies of dna .
it &apos;s able to feel when the cell is ready , when the chromo@@ some is cor@@ rec@@ tly posi@@ tioned .
humanity is now fully into the tech@@ no@@ -@@ scientific age .
during 4@@ 1 years of teaching biology at harvard , i watched sa@@ dly as bright students turned away from the possibility of a scientific career or even from taking non-@@ requi@@ red cour@@ ses in science because they were afraid of failure .
ju@@ dge opportunity by how few other students and researchers are on hand .
or larger , what &apos;s the role of dark matter in the expan@@ sion of the universe ?
humans have lived for much , much longer than the appro@@ x@@ ima@@ tely 10,000 years of sett@@ led agri@@ cultural civilization in small family groups . no@@ ma@@ di@@ c h@@ unter@@ s bring down rab@@ bits , gather@@ ing food .
more recently , that power is un@@ te@@ ther@@ ing and le@@ ap@@ ing off the des@@ k@@ tops , and very , very quickly , we &apos;re going to see a significant propor@@ tion , if not the majority of the human race , walking around holding , carrying or wearing super@@ computers lin@@ ked at spee@@ ds greater than what we consider to be broad@@ band today .
he used the example of a common gra@@ zing area in which each person by simply ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ zing their own flo@@ ck led to over@@ gra@@ zing and the de@@ ple@@ tion of the resource .
to@@ y@@ ota , instead of tre@@ ating its supp@@ li@@ ers as a market@@ place , tre@@ ats them as a network and tra@@ ins them to produce better , even though they are also training them to produce better for their competi@@ tors .
what forms of suffering could be alle@@ vi@@ ated , what forms of wealth could be created if we knew a little bit more about co@@ operation ?
now , i &apos;ll show you a fun ap@@ p that -- we &apos;ve been working on a collaboration with our friends at fli@@ ck@@ r .
yeah , yeah , back to the corner , back to the corner .
bla@@ ise ag@@ ü@@ era y arc@@ as : aug@@ ment@@ e@@ d-@@ reality maps
this was in prepar@@ ation for a mer@@ ger and ac@@ qu@@ isi@@ tion .
and if you remember the story about s@@ is@@ y@@ ph@@ us , s@@ is@@ y@@ ph@@ us was pun@@ ished by the go@@ ds to push the same rock up a h@@ ill , and when he almost got to the end , the rock would roll over , and he would have to start again .
what happened ?
i said , &quot; how many of you now go home earlier than you used to ? &quot;
so you take a piece , you just put it on the side .
the next part i want to show you is something about the positive motivation .
you had to measure the milk and add it , mix@@ ing it .
at the top of the she@@ et , we had little diagra@@ ms of how do you fold origami .
by the way , these are my kids , which , of course , are wonderful and so on .
and we &apos;re actually cam@@ bo@@ di@@ ans .
this is a picture of what pur@@ sat looks like .
but for us it meant freedom .
one day a man told me , &quot; my future does not look brilliant , but i want to have a brilliant future for my son . &quot;
so the key here is empathy .
we re@@ vis@@ ed the mental health compon@@ ent of the primary health care services by ad@@ ding psycho@@ -@@ social care and psycho@@ -@@ social coun@@ sel@@ ors to the system .
when jun@@ gi@@ an analy@@ st inge miss@@ ma@@ hl vis@@ ited afghanistan , she saw the inner wo@@ unds of war -- wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad des@@ pair , trau@@ ma and depression . and yet , in this coun@@ ty of 30 million people , there were only two do@@ zen psychiat@@ ri@@ sts . miss@@ ma@@ hl talks about her work helping to build the country &apos;s system of psycho@@ social coun@@ sel@@ ing , pro@@ mot@@ ing both individual and , perhaps , national heal@@ ing .
that &apos;s true of european bio@@ fu@@ els .
top left , we have canada and australia , with enormous land areas , very high per capit@@ a consumption , 200 or 300 light bul@@ bs per person , and very low population den@@ si@@ ties .
wind power produ@@ ces a bit more , 2.@@ 5 wat@@ ts per square meter , but that &apos;s only twice as big as 1.@@ 25 wat@@ ts per square meter , so that means if you wanted literally to produce total energy consumption in all forms on average from wind far@@ ms , you need wind far@@ ms half the area of the u.@@ k .
but the same goes for rene@@ w@@ ables as well .
next , there &apos;s the he@@ ating le@@ ver .
so , if you wanted to get 16 light bul@@ bs , remember , today our total energy consumption is 1@@ 25 light bul@@ bs &apos; worth .
he mentioned four great world orche@@ str@@ as , and the fif@@ th one was ven@@ e@@ zu@@ ela &apos;s you@@ th sym@@ ph@@ ony orche@@ str@@ a .

from the minute a child &apos;s taught how to play an instrument , he &apos;s no longer poor .
think about it , all right ? i &apos;m going to answer the phone three different times .
behavi@@ oral mark@@ ers matter .
that actually occur@@ red this year . she took early reti@@ re@@ ment .
we are obs@@ essed with this way of thinking .
classi@@ c . hi@@ p fra@@ c@@ ture often leads to institu@@ tion@@ alization of a sen@@ ior .
these disco@@ ver@@ ies of behavi@@ oral mark@@ ers , and behavi@@ oral changes are game changing , and like the discovery of the microscop@@ e because of our colle@@ cting data stre@@ ams that we &apos;ve actually never done before .
it &apos;s achie@@ vable . we should do it econom@@ ically , we should do it mor@@ ally , and we should do it for quality of life .
we will see 3@@ 0,000 new infe@@ cted web@@ sites .
this is the market leader in mal@@ ware distribution , the black hole explo@@ it pack , responsible for nearly one third of mal@@ ware distribution in the last couple of quar@@ ters .
so this is writing out the mali@@ cious code , and a few seconds later , on the le@@ ft@@ -@@ hand side , you &apos;ll see the attac@@ ker &apos;s screen get some interesting new text .
what &apos;s really insu@@ l@@ ting about this is not only does it provide the attac@@ kers with access to your data , but when the scan fin@@ ish@@ es , they tell you in order to clean up the fa@@ ke viruses , you have to regi@@ ster the product .
a little more se@@ arch@@ ing , and here &apos;s our cyber@@ crimin@@ al .
okay ? so you can see a list of wir@@ eless networks .
you see , technology &apos;s changing at a st@@ ag@@ ger@@ ing rate , and that 25@@ 0,000 pieces of mal@@ ware won &apos;t stay the same for long .
i wasn &apos;t very good at reading things .
you all know the story , right .
and that was really cool .
it was extraordinary .
&quot; you can call it a dinosau@@ r , but look at the vel@@ o@@ ci@@ ra@@ p@@ tor : the vel@@ o@@ ci@@ ra@@ p@@ tor is cool . &quot;
and they obviously make a lot of money off of them .
and so he agre@@ ed .
and quite frank@@ ly , i think if col@@ on@@ el s@@ anders was to be care@@ ful how he wor@@ ded it , he could actually adverti@@ se an extra piece .
that &apos;s based on diet in@@ take sur@@ ve@@ ys , it &apos;s based on levels of o@@ bes@@ ity , it &apos;s based on a range of fac@@ tors that gives you an appro@@ x@@ ima@@ te guess as to how much food is actually going into people &apos;s mou@@ ths .
that &apos;s what &apos;s in fields around the world every single year .
go one step up , and you get to farmers , who throw away sometimes a third or even more of their harv@@ est because of co@@ s@@ me@@ tic standards .
the one in the middle , on my kitchen table . not much difference .
western countries throw out nearly half of their food , not because it &apos;s ine@@ di@@ ble -- but because it doesn &apos;t look appe@@ aling . tri@@ stra@@ m stu@@ art del@@ ves into the sho@@ cking data of wa@@ sted food , calling for a more responsible use of global resources .
and this is all done , by the way , by the international astronom@@ ical union .
now , we &apos;re going to be going to mars one day . and when we do , it &apos;s going to be un@@ fair for the people that are living there to have to live with these ridi@@ cul@@ ous names .
&quot; listen , i &apos;m going back to the s@@ w@@ amp mer@@ ma@@ id . can you call me in a little while ? &quot;
we have names for places where people don &apos;t exist .
blue che@@ ese , ran@@ ch , oil and v@@ ine@@ gar , thousand is@@ lands and house .
now this is is@@ a@@ a@@ c from a viet@@ nam@@ ese stam@@ p .
he &apos;s all mur@@ ky . there is little kids le@@ an@@ ing on his leg , little g@@ ho@@ sts flying around . we got@@ ta clean this stuff up fast , ladies and gentle@@ men .
prime numbers , g@@ aus@@ s , one of my favor@@ ites .
every top ad@@ ds up to 3@@ 7 .
it just seems like it &apos;s not sex@@ y and elegan@@ t , it &apos;s hidden .
thank you .
it was incredibly successful .
it thought of itself as being dis@@ connected from the internet , but it was possible for somebody to s@@ mu@@ g@@ gle a us@@ b drive in there , or something like that , and software got in there that causes the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ges , in that case , to actually destro@@ y themselves .
and so if you hear an exper@@ t talking about the internet and saying it can do this , or it does do this , or it will do that , you should treat it with the same skep@@ tic@@ ism that you might treat the comm@@ ents of an econom@@ ist about the economy or a wea@@ ther@@ man about the weather , or something like that .
good after@@ noon .
so military technologies can influence the course of the world , can make or break world peace -- and there lies the issue with cy@@ ber weapons .
today we &apos;re moving to a multi@@ pol@@ ar world in which co@@ ordin@@ ation is much more complicated , as we have seen at cop@@ en@@ ha@@ gen .
before that day , this is how i saw the ocean .
speaking of dinosaurs , sharks are basically the same fish they were 300 million years ago .
of course , sea cu@@ cum@@ bers sho@@ ot them out their re@@ ars , which , in my opini@@ on , makes them much more interesting a super@@ hero .
and he does manage to find them , but great navi@@ gation skills , l@@ ous@@ y pi@@ ck@@ -up lines .
i couldn &apos;t fit them in .
s@@ her@@ man &apos;s up in shark hea@@ ven .
and you &apos;re getting all kinds of cool stuff .
in the lower 4@@ 8 , the far@@ th@@ est you can get away from a main@@ tain@@ ed road is 20 miles .
the ta@@ hl@@ tan have called for the creation of a tri@@ b@@ al her@@ it@@ age reser@@ ve which will set asi@@ de the largest prote@@ cted area in british colum@@ bia .
multi@@ p@@ ly 22 times 4@@ 7 , make sure you get 1,@@ 0@@ 3@@ 4 , or the calcul@@ ators are not working . do all of you get 1,@@ 0@@ 3@@ 4 ? 1,@@ 0@@ 3@@ 4 ?
5@@ 29 .
7@@ 22 is 500 -- o@@ oh , that &apos;s a harder one .
in the mean@@ while , let me conclu@@ de the first part of my show by doing something a little tri@@ ck@@ ier .
ok , any six of them .
audience : febru@@ ary .
what year , chris , would you like ?
audience : six . six .
now , 5@@ 7 times 6@@ 8 is 3@@ ,@@ 400 , plus 4@@ 7@@ 6 is 3@@ 8@@ 7@@ 6 , that &apos;s 3@@ 8@@ ,@@ 7@@ 60 plus 17@@ 1 , 3@@ 8@@ ,@@ 7@@ 60 plus 17@@ 1 is 3@@ 8@@ ,@@ 9@@ 3@@ 1 .
a third time , it &apos;s just being a techni@@ cian .
change is happening , and the change that is happening is not one that is in software .
had colle@@ cted photographs of me , as mothers will do .
and i &apos;ll just say what i &apos;m about to do . what i &apos;m about to do -- i hope you can recognize that there &apos;s a di@@ stor@@ ted s@@ ine wave , almost a tri@@ ang@@ ular wave upon this he@@ w@@ le@@ tt@@ -@@ pac@@ k@@ ard o@@ sc@@ il@@ lo@@ scop@@ e .
but you will need to know ei@@ gh@@ th-@@ grade al@@ ge@@ br@@ a , and we &apos;re going to do serious experiments .
now , so i know the frequ@@ ency .
i &apos;m going home for a mid@@ term . a ri@@ ot &apos;s going on on cam@@ pus .
i pop up the top , and there &apos;s a cu@@ pol@@ a .
well i &apos;m here to suggest there &apos;s a better way , that less might actually equal more .
secon@@ dly , our new man@@ tra : small is sex@@ y .
maybe , just maybe , less might equal more .
that fix@@ ed behavior -- which is ri@@ gi@@ d and stere@@ ot@@ yp@@ ed and ends up with a me@@ al -- changes .
if we &apos;ve got them wired up with an electro@@ en@@ cep@@ hal@@ ogra@@ m , the right brain of each of them becomes att@@ un@@ ed , so that the jo@@ y@@ ful emergen@@ ce of this earli@@ est of play scen@@ es and the physi@@ ology of that is something we &apos;re beginning to get a hand@@ le on .
this happens to be ok -- he &apos;s an an@@ atom@@ ically interested little boy and that &apos;s his mom . other situations wouldn &apos;t be quite so good .
they &apos;d given me a large gr@@ ant when i was an acade@@ mi@@ cian for the study of fel@@ ony dr@@ un@@ ken dri@@ vers , and i thought i had a pretty good track record , and by the time i had spent half an hour talking about play , it was obvious that they were not -- did not feel that play was serious .
and i think if you think about life without play -- no humor , no fli@@ r@@ tation , no movies , no games , no fan@@ t@@ asy and , and , and .
found that when he looked at a play@@ ground out of a window into which he had been con@@ fin@@ ed , he felt something different .
characteri@@ zed by a feeling of energi@@ zed focus , full invol@@ vement and success in the process of the activity .
and its hu@@ gely important in learning and cra@@ f@@ ting the brain .
we decided to do something a little bit different and transform fla@@ vor@@ s that were very familiar -- so in this case , so we take a car@@ rot ca@@ ke , put it in a bl@@ ender , and we have kind of like a car@@ rot ca@@ ke ju@@ ice , and then that went into a ballo@@ on fro@@ zen in liquid ni@@ tro@@ gen to create this hol@@ low sh@@ ell of car@@ rot ca@@ ke ice cre@@ am , i guess , and it comes off looking like , you know , ju@@ pit@@ er &apos;s flo@@ ating around your pla@@ te .
h@@ c : so , after about a day of chris and i star@@ ing at each other , we came up with something that was pretty close to the ham@@ bur@@ ger pat@@ ty , and as you can see it basically forms like ham@@ bur@@ ger meat .
h@@ c : so this is where we step into the future and we le@@ ap@@ fro@@ g ahead .
so , why don &apos;t we hear more about the world ?
where &apos;s art ? i got produ@@ c@@ tivity . i got spor@@ ts .
and one of them is called ta@@ ket@@ a . which is which ?
the full videos are online if you are interested .
but if i come up really close and st@@ are directly at the camera on this laptop then you &apos;ll see these nice cris@@ p eyes .
i &apos;d like to show you thing called s@@ n@@ out , which is -- the idea behind this project is to make a robot that appe@@ ars as if it &apos;s contin@@ ually surprised to see you .
if this virus was in thousands of individuals at this point , why was it the case that it took us until 198@@ 4 to be able to discover this virus ?
deep in a remote region of c@@ amer@@ o@@ on , two h@@ unter@@ s stal@@ k their pre@@ y .
they &apos;re also going to ask you the question that when we knew that this was the way that hiv enter@@ ed into the human population , and that other diseases had the potential to enter like this , why did we let these behaviors continue ?
paul worked for years on the c@@ amer@@ o@@ oni@@ an national radio and television , and he spoke about health issues . he was a health cor@@ respon@@ dent .
and let &apos;s face it , any new retro@@ virus in the human population -- it &apos;s something we should be aware of .
and because of that announ@@ c@@ ement , we got a big article in the new york times , which led to more press , which led to more attention , and me deci@@ ding to become ce@@ o of that company -- whereas i was just an ad@@ vis@@ er -- and raising a round of vent@@ ure capital and ra@@ mp@@ ing up hir@@ ing .
and they &apos;re t@@ we@@ eting , in some cases , from behind clo@@ se@@ d-@@ door s@@ essi@@ ons with the president .
people have raised tens of thousands of dollars over twitter in a matter of days on several occasi@@ ons .
my mother says that i started reading at the age of two , although i think four is probably close to the truth .
my mother was an admini@@ str@@ ator .
i must say that before i went to the u.s. i didn &apos;t consci@@ ously identify as african .
the political climate in the u.s. at the time was ten@@ se , and there were deb@@ ates going on about im@@ migra@@ tion .
when i learned , some years ago , that wri@@ ters were expected to have had really un@@ happy child@@ ho@@ ods to be successful , i began to think about how i could inv@@ ent horri@@ ble things my parents had done to me .
now , the conven@@ tional wisdom was that nigeri@@ ans don &apos;t read liter@@ ature .
she introduced them to a book about the southern life that they had left behind : &quot; they sat around , reading the book themselves , listening to me read the book , and a kind of par@@ ad@@ ise was re@@ ga@@ ined . &quot;
it literally fl@@ at@@ -@@ lin@@ ed .
well for the sa@@ ke of time , i want to focus on just three strategi@@ es .
we need to fundament@@ ally re@@ define who it is that experts are .
i &apos;m looking for a third way : i &apos;m prepar@@ ing to get alzheimer &apos;s disease .
would they give me char@@ ts and graph@@ s that i could color ?
al@@ an@@ na sha@@ i@@ k@@ h : how i &apos;m prepar@@ ing to get alzheimer &apos;s
the network has two components in them .
the battery is not the gas t@@ ank , in a sense .
and these pri@@ ces are actually with clean electr@@ ons .
and i had to qu@@ it and come and do this thing called a better place .
as we star@@ ed sc@@ aling it up we looked at what is the problem to come up to the u.s. ?
we go back down . it &apos;s going to go up and down .
now where is the car industry on that ?
now when we &apos;re looking at solving big problems , we need to start thinking in two numbers .
we have to make the right moral decision .
they see us as ro@@ cking the boat , and you can understand why .
complexity is the problem that any theory of biology has to solve , and you can &apos;t solve it by post@@ ul@@ ating an ag@@ ent that is even more complex , there@@ by simply com@@ po@@ unding the problem .
now , there &apos;s a typical scientific journ@@ al , the quar@@ ter@@ ly re@@ view of biology .
and however we define athei@@ s@@ m , it &apos;s sur@@ ely the kind of acade@@ mic belief that a person is enti@@ t@@ led to hold without being vili@@ fied as an un@@ patri@@ o@@ tic , un@@ elec@@ table non-@@ citi@@ zen .
in 199@@ 8 , lar@@ son and with@@ am po@@ ll@@ ed the cre@@ am of american scientists , those who &apos;d been hon@@ or@@ ed by ele@@ ction to the national acade@@ my of sci@@ ences , and among this sele@@ ct group , belief in a personal god dro@@ pped to a sh@@ at@@ ter@@ ing seven percent .
darwin said , &quot; i have never been an athei@@ st in the same sense of den@@ ying the existence of a god .
non@@ eth@@ eless , if we want to attra@@ ct deep down athei@@ sts to come out publi@@ c@@ ly , we &apos;re going to have find something better to stick on our ban@@ ner than &quot; to@@ oth fair@@ y &quot; or &quot; tea@@ po@@ t ag@@ no@@ stic . &quot;
we need an anti-@@ temp@@ le@@ ton to step forward .
what this picture suggests to us is that we &apos;ve got a radical change in the way information production and exchange is capit@@ alized . not that it &apos;s become less capital inten@@ sive -- that there &apos;s less money that &apos;s requi@@ red -- but that the ow@@ ner@@ ship of this capital , the way the capit@@ alization happens , is radi@@ cally distribu@@ ted . each of us , in these advanced econom@@ ies , has one of these , or something rather like it -- a computer .
the critical innovation here is instead of our engineers , or our people saying which is the most relevant , we &apos;re going to go out and count what you , people out there on the web , for whatever reason -- van@@ ity , pleasure -- produced links , and ti@@ ed to each other . we &apos;re going to count those , and count them up .
and if dinner isn &apos;t entirely obvious , think of sex .
but -- and this is the dark lin@@ ing -- it is thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed by -- in the same way that it thre@@ at@@ ens -- the in@@ cum@@ b@@ ent industrial systems .
due to some sli@@ p-@@ u@@ ps , he managed to es@@ cape d@@ ressed as a woman and ran from london back to nigeria where , according to our const@@ it@@ ution , those in office as gover@@ nor@@ s , president -- as in many countries -- have imm@@ unity and cannot be pro@@ se@@ cu@@ ted . but what happened : people were so ou@@ tra@@ ged by this behavior that it was possible for his state leg@@ is@@ l@@ ature to im@@ pe@@ ach him and get him out of office .
we are gr@@ ate@@ ful , but we know that we can take charge of our own dest@@ in@@ ies if we have the will to re@@ form .
and in the three years that i was fin@@ ance minister , they made an average of 3@@ 60 million dollars profit per year .
and what is more important , because we want to get away from oil and diver@@ si@@ fy -- and there are so many opportunities in this one big country , as in many countries in africa -- what was remarkable is that much of this growth came not from the oil sector alone , but from non-@@ oil .
not all of them have been perfect , or will be , but the trend is very clear .
so , she &apos;ll make a little pair of d@@ ung@@ are@@ es with cor@@ du@@ ro@@ ys , with african material mix@@ ed in . very creative designs , has reach@@ ed a stage where she even had an order from wal@@ -@@ m@@ art .
every year , 3@@ 6@@ ,000 people in the united states die of seas@@ onal flu .
this worked well for most pa@@ tho@@ gens , some@@ what well for cra@@ f@@ ty bu@@ gs like flu , but not at all for hiv , for which humans have no natural imm@@ unity .
and also , what the anti@@ bodies use is a hand@@ le to essentially gra@@ b and neu@@ tr@@ alize the virus .
many thought that it was just impossible to make an aids v@@ acc@@ ine , but today , evidence tells us otherwise .
in the longer term , what they can do is use these tools of retro@@ -@@ vac@@ cin@@ ology to make a pre@@ ven@@ tive flu v@@ acc@@ ine .
lu@@ ck@@ ily for us , we live in an era of brea@@ th@@ taking bi@@ ome@@ di@@ cal advan@@ ces .
india , mexico and others are already making experiment@@ al flu vac@@ cin@@ es , and they may be the first place we see these vac@@ cin@@ es in use .
s@@ b : you know , everybody says it &apos;s 10 years , but it &apos;s been 10 years every 10 years .
and these are not really a people op@@ pres@@ sed by poverty .
i would also like to pay ho@@ ma@@ ge and honor to the ted fel@@ lo@@ ws jun@@ e ar@@ ung@@ a , james shi@@ k@@ wat@@ i , andre@@ w , and the other ted fel@@ lo@@ ws .
did you know that 40 percent of the wealth created in africa is not invest@@ ed here in africa ?
i bel@@ ong to an internet discussion for@@ um , an african internet discussion for@@ um , and i asked them , i said , &quot; since 1960 , we &apos;ve had exactly 20@@ 4 african heads of state , since 1960 . &quot;
that &apos;s not wealth creation . it &apos;s wealth re@@ distribution .
if you look into their traditional systems , afri@@ cans organi@@ ze their states in two types .
and when they produce their cro@@ ps , they sell the sur@@ plus on market@@ places .
a bigger boat will mean more fish will be caught and land@@ ed .
and i was sure that it was going to be great for democracy and for our society .
scot@@ t &apos;s results were full of them .
and the challenge with these kinds of algorith@@ mic fil@@ ters , these person@@ alized fil@@ ters , is that , because they &apos;re main@@ ly looking at what you click on first , it can throw off that balance .
we need it to introdu@@ ce us to new ideas and new people and different perspe@@ c@@ tives .
she said &quot; yes , that &apos;s former vice president al gore and his wife ti@@ pp@@ er . &quot;
just in the last two days , we got the new temperature recor@@ ds in janu@@ ary .
a lot of us in here have made that decision and it is really pretty easy .
help with the mass per@@ su@@ asi@@ on campaign that will start this spring .
and all the burning of oil and coal and gas , all the fossil fu@@ els , have changed the atmosphere great@@ ly .
you go in along the sh@@ ore , you can find it everywhere .
so this is the gul@@ f of mexico , spar@@ kl@@ ing place full of fish .
but he told ted that on the last day he went out , a bot@@ t@@ len@@ o@@ se dolph@@ in suddenly appe@@ ared next to the boat , and it was sp@@ lat@@ ter@@ ing oil out its blo@@ whole .
we &apos;re starting with something that &apos;s had a lot of st@@ res@@ ses and a lot of problems to begin with .
here are sh@@ ri@@ mp bo@@ ats emplo@@ yed .
it turns out that -- you see this sign on almost every commercial ves@@ sel in the united states -- you know , if you sp@@ ill@@ ed a couple of gall@@ ons of oil , you would be in big trouble .
there &apos;s certainly a common theme about nee@@ ding to make the moment out of this .
well i built a fusion re@@ actor when i was 14 years old .
ta@@ yl@@ or wil@@ son : y@@ up , i built a nuclear fusion re@@ actor
everybody : i am my connec@@ tom@@ e .
you can recognize them inst@@ antly by their fantastic shapes .
we color every neuron in , in a different color , and then we look through all of the images , find the sy@@ nap@@ ses and note the colors of the two neurons involved in each sy@@ nap@@ se .
but may i ?
and there &apos;s a lot of evidence that neu@@ ral activity is en@@ co@@ ding our thoughts , feelings and per@@ cep@@ tions , our mental experiences .
let us attemp@@ t to read out memor@@ ies from connec@@ tom@@ es .
if you believe that i am my connec@@ tom@@ e , i think you must also accept the idea that death is the destruction of your connec@@ tom@@ e .
z@@ ach ka@@ plan : kei@@ th and i lead a research team .
because the way that he pres@@ ented the concept -- his approach was totally different than ours . he sold it to you as if it was for s@@ ale right now .
now , i &apos;m not going to get into the physics of it , but all you need to know is that the faster the mag@@ net &apos;s fall@@ ing , the greater the stopp@@ ing force .
z@@ k : i &apos;d just like to let you all know that this pres@@ entation has been brought to you by target .
while he was doing this , he noticed an un@@ expected thing .
pac@@ k@@ aging that changes color when your milk &apos;s gone off .
z@@ ach ka@@ plan + kei@@ th scha@@ cht : to@@ ys and materials from the future
can we produce a men@@ u that &apos;s deli@@ cious without fo@@ ie gras ?
&quot; span@@ ish che@@ f acc@@ used ... &quot; -- and the french acc@@ used him .
he &apos;s really just in love with -- he &apos;s at one with -- he &apos;s the goo@@ se wh@@ is@@ per@@ er .
even though they were im@@ pris@@ oned in this garden of e@@ den with fi@@ gs and everything else .
his biggest ob@@ stac@@ le , really , was the market@@ place , which dem@@ ands these days bright yellow fo@@ ie gras .
and he grab@@ s my arm and the transl@@ ator &apos;s , and du@@ cks us under a bush and says , &quot; watch this . &quot;
they don &apos;t need anything more . &quot;
but i can taste things .
i really was moved .
he ta@@ sted it and fell in love with it .
if human beings disappe@@ ared , life on earth as we know it would fl@@ our@@ ish . &quot;
but now we need a new fire that makes us safe , sec@@ ure , healthy and dur@@ able .
let me say that again .
america could lead this next automo@@ tive revolution .
we can use some smart it to en@@ h@@ ance trans@@ it and en@@ able car sharing and ride sharing .
most of it now is wa@@ sted and the technologies for saving it keep impro@@ ving faster than we &apos;re inst@@ all@@ ing them .
well , from the coal bur@@ ned at the power plant through all these com@@ po@@ unding los@@ ses , only a tent@@ h of the fuel energy actually ends up coming out the pi@@ pe as flow .
and when a big plant goes down , you lose a thousand me@@ ga@@ wat@@ ts in milli@@ seconds , often for weeks or months , often without war@@ ning .
in 197@@ 6 , for example , government and industry insi@@ sted that the amount of energy needed to make a dollar of g@@ dp could never go down .
thank you .
and third , the engagement in developing countries was with a nar@@ row set of government eli@@ tes with little interaction with the citizens , who are the ulti@@ mate bene@@ fi@@ ci@@ aries of development assi@@ stance .
in this map from mol@@ do@@ va , the green color shows those distri@@ cts that have low spending on schools but good edu@@ cational out@@ comes , and the red color shows the opposite .
we will find that these children , too , have a real chance of breaking their way out of poverty .
if we take the to@@ o@@ th@@ br@@ ush -- i don &apos;t think about the to@@ o@@ th@@ br@@ ush .
after , we become a fish ; after , we become a fro@@ g ; after , we become a mon@@ key ; after , we become what we are today : a super@@ -@@ mon@@ key , and the fun is , the super@@ -@@ mon@@ key we are today , is at half of the story .
if you walk like that , it &apos;s ok , it &apos;s ok , you can walk , but perhaps , because you walk with the eyes like that , you will not see , oh , there is a hole .
if you look like that , you look to the past , or you look inside if you are very flexi@@ ble , inside yourself .
that &apos;s why we must ada@@ pt .
we can say to our children , ok , done , that was our story . that passed .
no sl@@ ou@@ ching , no pants han@@ ging down , none of that stuff .
and the dri@@ ll ser@@ ge@@ ant starts scre@@ aming at them , and telling them to do all kinds of awful things .
no , no , it begins the first time a child in a mother &apos;s arms looks up at the mother and says , &quot; oh , this must be my mother .
the last chap@@ ter in my book is called &quot; the gift of a good start . &quot;
give him to the army . we &apos;ll never see him again . we &apos;ll never see him again . &quot;
you get a job and get out of the house .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , it &apos;s okay . &quot;
i &apos;m a marke@@ ter , and as a marke@@ ter , i know that i &apos;ve never really been in control .
h@@ ul@@ u and net@@ fli@@ x , among other companies , have open vac@@ ation poli@@ cies .
the days are past when a person , company or brand could ti@@ ghtly control their repu@@ tation -- online ch@@ at@@ ter and sp@@ in mean that if you &apos;re relevant , there &apos;s a const@@ ant , fre@@ e-@@ form conversation happening about you that you have no control over . tim le@@ ber@@ echt off@@ ers three big ideas about accep@@ ting that loss of control , even designing for it -- and using it as an im@@ pe@@ tus to re@@ com@@ mit to your values .
they want to make people live in fear .
but people did not rel@@ ate to this .
they were actually attac@@ king them .
seriously , with the amount of change i had noticed in this square , i thought it was 12 years .
i feel that i have dig@@ ni@@ ty that i have lost for so many years . &quot;
so we &apos;ve been studying the babies using a techni@@ que that we &apos;re using all over the world and the sounds of all languages .
so babies absor@@ b the statistics of the language and it changes their brains ; it changes them from the citizens of the world to the cul@@ tu@@ re-@@ bo@@ und listen@@ ers that we are .
whatever you put in front of them , they &apos;ll take statistics on .
in investi@@ g@@ ating the child &apos;s brain , we &apos;re going to un@@ cover deep tru@@ ths about what it means to be human , and in the process , we may be able to help keep our own minds open to learning for our entire lives .
but i have to tell you a funny story .
so what happened now is , when the water@@ color was flo@@ wing into the structure , the water@@ colors do not mix with the fer@@ ro@@ flu@@ id .
i could do it again to show it one more time , but some would argue that this is a complete waste of the wh@@ is@@ key , and that i should rather drink it .
in that ho@@ spi@@ ce , there were 3@@ 1 men and women who were ac@@ tively dying .
and my family brought in a woman whose mother had been a sla@@ ve to take care of me .
and you know , we have a society , a world , that is paraly@@ zed by fear .
but it also takes a soft front -- the capacity to really be open to the world as it is , to have an un@@ defen@@ ded heart .
may we actu@@ alize that capacity for women everywhere .
now , it &apos;s no surprise that when you add con@@ se@@ cu@@ tive fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i numbers , you get the next fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i number . right ?
bene@@ ath that , i &apos;ll put a two-@@ b@@ y-@@ two square , and next to that , a three-@@ b@@ y-@@ three square , bene@@ ath that , a five-@@ b@@ y-@@ five square , and then an ei@@ ght-@@ b@@ y-@@ eight square , creating one giant rec@@ tan@@ gle , right ?
now , being ir@@ ani@@ an-@@ american pres@@ ents its own set of problems , as you know .
and i started fre@@ a@@ king out , because i don &apos;t know what kind of cra@@ p my grand@@ father was into .
but what was interesting was , the paki@@ stan@@ i musli@@ m guy -- see he gives a bad name to musli@@ ms and middle e@@ ast@@ ern@@ ers and paki@@ stan@@ is from all over the world .
he goes , &quot; i &apos;m going to the zar@@ a store . it &apos;s three miles away .
i go , &quot; he &apos;s got to be my driver . &quot;
mar@@ co temp@@ est : when asked about de@@ ception , he said this : magic is the only honest prof@@ ession .
where is the queen ?
i &apos;m going to show you how terror@@ ism actually inter@@ acts with our daily life .
at the same time , while i was intervie@@ wing the red bri@@ ga@@ des , i also discovered that their life was not rul@@ ed by politics or ide@@ ology , but actually was rul@@ ed by economics .
so , i decided that i wanted to investi@@ gate the economics of terror@@ ism .
but the great change came , of course , with glob@@ alization and der@@ e@@ gu@@ lation .
now , when i went to look at the fig@@ ures of the u.s. money supply , the u.s. money supply is the amount of dollars that the fe@@ der@@ al reser@@ ve prin@@ ts every year in order to satis@@ fy which , of course , refle@@ cts the growth of the economy .
now , the eur@@ o was a new@@ ly born cur@@ ren@@ cy of great opportunity for business , and , of course , for investment .
this has given me a very special relationship with the ocean .
i wanted to live a life that i could be proud of .
i don &apos;t think i &apos;ve ever felt so happy in my entire life .
i don &apos;t see anybody for the whole time that i &apos;m at sea , generally .
