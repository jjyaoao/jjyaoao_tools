and it can be a very complicated thing , what human health is .
and bringing those two together might seem a very da@@ un@@ ting task , but what i &apos;m going to try to say is that even in that complexity , there &apos;s some simple the@@ mes that i think , if we understand , we can really move forward .
and those simple the@@ mes aren &apos;t really the@@ mes about the complex science of what &apos;s going on , but things that we all pretty well know .
and i &apos;m going to start with this one : if mom@@ ma a@@ in &apos;t happy , a@@ in &apos;t nobody happy .
we know that , right ? we &apos;ve experienced that .
and if we just take that and we build from there , then we can go to the next step , which is that if the ocean a@@ in &apos;t happy , a@@ in &apos;t nobody happy .
that &apos;s the theme of my talk .
and we &apos;re making the ocean pretty un@@ happy in a lot of different ways .
this is a shot of can@@ ner@@ y row in 19@@ 32 .
can@@ ner@@ y row , at the time , had the biggest industrial can@@ ning operation on the west coast .
we pil@@ ed enormous amo@@ unts of pollution into the air and into the water .
ro@@ l@@ f bo@@ lin , who was a professor at the hop@@ k@@ in &apos;s marine station where i work , wrote in the 194@@ 0s that &quot; the f@@ um@@ es from the sc@@ um flo@@ ating on the in@@ lets of the bay were so bad they turned le@@ ad@@ -@@ based pain@@ ts black . &quot;
people working in these can@@ ner@@ ies could bar@@ ely stay there all day because of the smell , but you know what they came out saying ?
they say , &quot; you know what you smell ?
that pollution was money to that community , and those people de@@ alt with the pollution and absor@@ bed it into their skin and into their bodies because they needed the money .
we made the ocean un@@ happy ; we made people very un@@ happy , and we made them un@@ healthy .
the connection between ocean health and human health is actually based upon another couple simple ada@@ ges , and i want to call that &quot; pin@@ ch a min@@ now , hurt a wh@@ ale . &quot;
the pyrami@@ d of ocean life ...
now , when an ec@@ ologist looks at the ocean -- i have to tell you -- we look at the ocean in a very different way , and we see different things than when a regular person looks at the ocean because when an ec@@ ologist looks at the ocean , we see all those inter@@ connections .
we see the base of the food chain , the plan@@ k@@ ton , the small things , and we see how those animals are food to animals in the middle of the pyrami@@ d , and on so up this diagra@@ m .
and that flow , that flow of life , from the very base up to the very top , is the flow that e@@ col@@ o@@ gi@@ sts see .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to preser@@ ve when we say , &quot; save the ocean . he@@ al the ocean . &quot;
now why does that matter for human health ?
because when we ja@@ m things in the bottom of that pyrami@@ d that shouldn &apos;t be there , some very fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing things happen .
pollu@@ tan@@ ts , some pollu@@ tan@@ ts have been created by us : molecules like p@@ c@@ bs that can &apos;t be broken down by our bodies .
and they go in the base of that pyrami@@ d , and they dri@@ ft up ; they &apos;re passed up that way , on to predat@@ ors and on to the top predat@@ ors , and in so doing , they accu@@ mu@@ late .
now , to bring that home , i thought i &apos;d inv@@ ent a little game .
we don &apos;t really have to play it ; we can just think about it here .
it &apos;s the sty@@ ro@@ fo@@ am and cho@@ col@@ ate game .
imagine that when we got on this boat , we were all given two sty@@ ro@@ fo@@ am pe@@ an@@ u@@ ts .
can &apos;t do much with them : put them in your po@@ cket .
suppose the rules are : every time you offer somebody a drink , you give them the drink , and you give them your sty@@ ro@@ fo@@ am pe@@ an@@ u@@ ts too .
what &apos;ll happen is that the sty@@ ro@@ fo@@ am pe@@ an@@ u@@ ts will start moving through our society here , and they will accu@@ mu@@ late in the dr@@ un@@ k@@ est , stin@@ gi@@ est people .
there &apos;s no mechan@@ ism in this game for them to go anywhere but into a bigger and bigger pi@@ le of indi@@ ge@@ sti@@ ble sty@@ ro@@ fo@@ am pe@@ an@@ u@@ ts .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens with p@@ d@@ bs in this food pyrami@@ d : they accu@@ mu@@ late into the top of it .
now suppose , instead of sty@@ ro@@ fo@@ am pe@@ an@@ u@@ ts , we take these lo@@ vely little cho@@ col@@ ates that we get and we had those instead .
well , some of us would be eating those cho@@ col@@ ates instead of pas@@ sing them around , and instead of acc@@ um@@ ul@@ ating , they will just pass into our group here and not accu@@ mu@@ late in any one group because they &apos;re absor@@ bed by us .
and that &apos;s the difference between a p@@ c@@ b and , say , something natural like an ome@@ ga@@ -@@ 3 , something we want out of the marine food chain .
we have great examples of that , unfortunately .
p@@ c@@ bs accu@@ mu@@ late in dolph@@ ins in sar@@ as@@ ota bay , in texas , in north car@@ ol@@ ina .
they get into the food chain .
the dolph@@ ins eat the fish that have p@@ c@@ bs from the plan@@ k@@ ton , and those p@@ c@@ bs , being f@@ at@@ -@@ solu@@ ble , accu@@ mu@@ late in these dolph@@ ins .
now , a dolph@@ in , mother dolph@@ in , any dolph@@ in -- there &apos;s only one way that a p@@ c@@ b can get out of a dolph@@ in .
and what &apos;s that ?
here &apos;s a diagra@@ m of the p@@ c@@ b load of dolph@@ ins in sar@@ as@@ ota bay .
adult males : a huge load .
ju@@ ven@@ il@@ es : a huge load .
fe@@ males after their first cal@@ f is already we@@ an@@ ed : a lower load .
those fe@@ males , they &apos;re not trying to .
those fe@@ males are pas@@ sing the p@@ c@@ bs in the fat of their own mother &apos;s milk into their off@@ spring , and their off@@ spring don &apos;t survive .
the death rate in these dolph@@ ins , for the first cal@@ f born of every female dolph@@ in , is 60 to 80 percent .
these mothers pu@@ mp their first off@@ spring full of this pollu@@ t@@ ant , and most of them die .
now , the mother then can go and re@@ produce , but what a terrible price to pay for the accu@@ mu@@ lation of this pollu@@ t@@ ant in these animals -- the death of the fir@@ st-@@ born cal@@ f .
there &apos;s another top predat@@ or in the ocean , it turns out .
and we also are eating meat that comes from some of these same places .
this is wh@@ ale meat that i photograph@@ ed in a gro@@ cer@@ y store in to@@ k@@ yo -- or is it ?
in fact , what we did a few years ago was learn how to s@@ mu@@ g@@ gle a molecular biology lab into to@@ k@@ yo and use it to gene@@ tically test the dna out of wh@@ ale meat sam@@ ples and identify what they really were .
and some of those wh@@ ale meat sam@@ ples were wh@@ ale meat .
that &apos;s another story .
even though they were lab@@ el@@ ed wh@@ ale meat , they were dolph@@ in meat .
and those dolph@@ in parts had a huge load of p@@ c@@ bs , di@@ ox@@ ins and heavy met@@ als .
and that huge load was pas@@ sing into the people that ate this meat .
it turns out that a lot of dolph@@ ins are being sold as meat in the wh@@ ale meat market around the world .
that &apos;s a trage@@ dy for those popu@@ lations , but it &apos;s also a trage@@ dy for the people eating them because they don &apos;t know that that &apos;s tox@@ ic meat .
we had these data a few years ago .
i remember sitting at my des@@ k being about the only person in the world who knew that wh@@ ale meat being sold in these markets was really dolph@@ in meat , and it was tox@@ ic .
and i remember there sitting at my des@@ k thinking , &quot; well , i know this . this is a great scientific discovery , &quot; but it was so awful .
and for the very first time in my scientific career , i broke scientific proto@@ co@@ l , which is that you take the data and publi@@ sh them in scientific journ@@ als and then begin to talk about them .
we sent a very poli@@ te letter to the minister of health in japan and simply poin@@ ted out that this is an in@@ toler@@ able situation , not for us , but for the people of japan because mothers who may be bre@@ ast@@ fe@@ eding , who may have young children , would be buying something that they thought was healthy , but it was really tox@@ ic .
that led to a whole series of other campaig@@ ns in japan , and i &apos;m really proud to say that at this point , it &apos;s very difficult to buy anything in japan that &apos;s lab@@ el@@ ed in@@ cor@@ rec@@ tly , even though they &apos;re still selling wh@@ ale meat , which i believe they shouldn &apos;t .
but at least it &apos;s lab@@ el@@ ed cor@@ rec@@ tly , and you &apos;re no longer going to be buying tox@@ ic dolph@@ in meat instead .
it isn &apos;t just there that this happens , but in a natural diet of some communities in the can@@ adi@@ an arc@@ tic and in the united states and in the european arc@@ tic , a natural diet of se@@ als and wh@@ ales leads to an accu@@ mu@@ lation of p@@ c@@ bs that have gather@@ ed up from all parts of the world and ended up in these women .
these women have tox@@ ic breast milk .
they cannot feed their off@@ spring , their children , their breast milk because of the accu@@ mu@@ lation of these tox@@ ins in their food chain , in their part of the world &apos;s ocean pyrami@@ d .
that means their imm@@ une systems are com@@ promis@@ ed .
it means that their children &apos;s development can be com@@ promis@@ ed .
and the world &apos;s attention on this over the last decade has re@@ duced the problem for these women , not by changing the pyrami@@ d , but by changing what they particularly eat out of it .
we &apos;ve taken them out of their natural pyrami@@ d in order to solve this problem .
that &apos;s a good thing for this particular ac@@ ute problem , but it does nothing to solve the pyrami@@ d problem .
there &apos;s other ways of breaking the pyrami@@ d .
the pyrami@@ d , if we ja@@ m things in the bottom , can get bac@@ ked up like a se@@ wer line that &apos;s clo@@ g@@ ged .
and if we ja@@ m nutri@@ ents , se@@ wa@@ ge , ferti@@ li@@ zer in the base of that food pyrami@@ d , it can back up all through it .
we end up with things we &apos;ve heard about before : red ti@@ des , for example , which are blo@@ oms of tox@@ ic al@@ ga@@ e flo@@ ating through the oceans caus@@ ing neuro@@ logi@@ cal damage .
we can also see blo@@ oms of bacteria , blo@@ oms of viruses in the ocean .
these are two sh@@ ots of a red ti@@ de coming on sh@@ ore here and a bacteria in the gen@@ us vi@@ bri@@ o , which inclu@@ des the gen@@ us that has chol@@ era in it .
how many people have seen a &quot; beach closed &quot; sign ?
why does that happen ?
it happens because we have jam@@ med so much into the base of the natural ocean pyrami@@ d that these bacteria clo@@ g it up and over@@ fill onto our be@@ ach@@ es .
now how many of you have ever gone to a state park or a national park where you had a big sign at the front saying , &quot; closed because human se@@ wa@@ ge is so far over this park that you can &apos;t use it &quot; ?
not very often . we wouldn &apos;t toler@@ ate that .
we wouldn &apos;t toler@@ ate our par@@ ks being s@@ w@@ am@@ ped by human se@@ wa@@ ge , but be@@ ach@@ es are closed a lot in our country .
they &apos;re closed more and more and more all around the world for the same reason , and i believe we shouldn &apos;t toler@@ ate that either .
it &apos;s not just a question of cle@@ an@@ lin@@ ess ; it &apos;s also a question of how those organisms then turn into human disease .
these vi@@ bri@@ os , these bacteria , can actually infe@@ ct people .
they can go into your skin and create skin infe@@ ctions .
this is a graph from no@@ a@@ a &apos;s ocean and human health initiative , showing the rise of the infe@@ ctions by vi@@ bri@@ o in people over the last few years .
sur@@ f@@ ers , for example , know this incredibly .
and if you can see on some sur@@ fing sites , in fact , not only do you see what the waves are like or what the weather &apos;s like , but on some sur@@ f ri@@ der sites , you see a little flas@@ hing po@@ o al@@ ert .
that means that the beach might have great waves , but it &apos;s a dangerous place for sur@@ f@@ ers to be because they can carry with them , even after a great day of sur@@ fing , this leg@@ acy of an infe@@ ction that might take a very long time to solve .
some of these infe@@ ctions are actually carrying antibio@@ tic resi@@ stance genes now , and that makes them even more difficult .
these same infe@@ ctions create har@@ m@@ ful alg@@ al blo@@ oms .
those blo@@ oms are gener@@ ating other kinds of chemicals .
this is just a simple list of some of the types of po@@ is@@ ons that come out of these har@@ m@@ ful alg@@ al blo@@ oms : sh@@ ell@@ fish po@@ is@@ oning , fish ci@@ gu@@ at@@ era , di@@ arr@@ hei@@ c sh@@ ell@@ fish po@@ is@@ oning -- you don &apos;t want to know about that -- neuro@@ tox@@ ic sh@@ ell@@ fish po@@ is@@ oning , paraly@@ tic sh@@ ell@@ fish po@@ is@@ oning .
these are things that are getting into our food chain because of these blo@@ oms .
ri@@ ta cal@@ well very fam@@ ously tra@@ ced a very interesting story of chol@@ era into human communities , brought there , not by a normal human v@@ ec@@ tor , but by a marine v@@ ec@@ tor , this cop@@ e@@ po@@ d .
cop@@ e@@ po@@ ds are small cru@@ stac@@ e@@ ans .
they &apos;re a tiny fra@@ ction of an in@@ ch long , and they can carry on their little legs some of the chol@@ era bacteria that then leads to human disease .
that has spar@@ ked chol@@ era epide@@ mi@@ cs in por@@ ts along the world and has led to increas@@ ed concent@@ ration on trying to make sure shi@@ pping doesn &apos;t move these v@@ ec@@ tors of chol@@ era around the world .
so what do you do ?
we have major problems in dis@@ rup@@ ted ecosystem flow that the pyrami@@ d may not be working so well , that the flow from the base up into it is being blo@@ cked and clo@@ g@@ ged .
well , there &apos;s a bunch of things you could do .
you could call joe the pl@@ um@@ ber , for example .
and he could come in and fix the flow .
but in fact , if you look around the world , not only are there hope spo@@ ts for where we may be able to fix problems , there have been places where problems have been fix@@ ed , where people have come to gri@@ ps with these issues and be@@ gun to turn them around .
mon@@ ter@@ ey is one of those .
i started out showing how much we had dist@@ ressed the mon@@ ter@@ ey bay ecosystem with pollution and the can@@ ning industry and all of the atten@@ d@@ ant problems .
in 19@@ 32 , that &apos;s the picture .
in 2009 , the picture is dra@@ matically different .
the can@@ ner@@ ies are gone . the pollution has ab@@ ated .
but there &apos;s a greater sense here that what the individual communities need is working eco@@ systems .
they need a func@@ tion@@ ing pyrami@@ d from the base all the way to the top .
and that pyrami@@ d in mon@@ ter@@ ey , right now , because of the eff@@ or@@ ts of a lot of different people , is func@@ tion@@ ing better than it &apos;s ever func@@ tioned for the last 150 years .
it didn &apos;t happen acci@@ dent@@ ally .
it happened because many people put their time and effort and their pi@@ one@@ ering spirit into this .
on the left there , juli@@ a plat@@ t , the ma@@ yo@@ r of my little home@@ town in pacific gro@@ ve .
at 7@@ 4 years old , became ma@@ yo@@ r because something had to be done to protect the ocean .
in 193@@ 1 , she produced california &apos;s first commun@@ it@@ y-@@ based marine prote@@ cted area , right next to the biggest pollu@@ ting can@@ ner@@ y , because juli@@ a knew that when the can@@ ner@@ ies eventually were gone , the ocean needed a place to grow from , that the ocean needed a place to spar@@ k a se@@ ed , and she wanted to provide that se@@ ed .
other people , like david pac@@ k@@ ard and j@@ ul@@ ie pac@@ k@@ ard , who were instru@@ mental in producing the mon@@ ter@@ ey bay a@@ qu@@ ari@@ um to lock into people &apos;s notion that the ocean and the health of the ocean ecosystem were just as important to the economy of this area as eating the ecosystem would be .
that change in thinking has led to a dra@@ matic shift , not only in the fortun@@ es of mon@@ ter@@ ey bay , but other places around the world .
well , i want to leave you with the thought that what we &apos;re really trying to do here is protect this ocean pyrami@@ d , and that ocean pyrami@@ d conne@@ cts to our own pyrami@@ d of life .
it &apos;s an ocean planet , and we think of ourselves as a ter@@ restri@@ al species , but the pyrami@@ d of life in the ocean and our own lives on land are intri@@ c@@ ately connected .
and it &apos;s only through having the ocean being healthy that we can re@@ main healthy ourselves .
there &apos;s a ti@@ ght and surprising link between the ocean &apos;s health and ours , says marine biolog@@ ist ste@@ phen pal@@ um@@ bi . he shows how tox@@ ins at the bottom of the ocean food chain find their way into our bodies , with a sho@@ cking story of tox@@ ic cont@@ am@@ ination from a japanese fish market . his work points a way forward for saving the oceans &apos; health -- and humanity &apos;s .
ad@@ ri@@ an ko@@ hl@@ er : well , we &apos;re here today to talk about the evolution of a pu@@ p@@ pet horse .
bas@@ il j@@ ones : but actually we &apos;re going to start this evolution with a hy@@ en@@ a .
okay , we &apos;ll do something with it .
the hy@@ en@@ a is the ance@@ st@@ or of the horse because it was part of a production called &quot; fau@@ st@@ us in africa , &quot; a hand@@ spring production from 199@@ 5 , where it had to play dr@@ au@@ ghts with hel@@ en of tro@@ y .
this production was direc@@ ted by south african artist and theater director , willi@@ am k@@ ent@@ ri@@ dge .
so it needed a very artic@@ u@@ late front pa@@ w .
but , like all pu@@ p@@ pe@@ ts , it has other at@@ tribu@@ tes .
ak : ha@@ a ha@@ a ha@@ a@@ a .
b@@ j : breath is really important for us .
it &apos;s the kind of original movement for any pu@@ p@@ pet for us on@@ stage .
pu@@ p@@ pe@@ ts always have to try to be alive .
it &apos;s their kind of ur@@ -@@ story on@@ stage , that des@@ per@@ ation to live .
ak : yeah , it &apos;s basically a dead object , as you can see , and it only lives because you make it .
an actor strug@@ gles to die on@@ stage , but a pu@@ p@@ pet has to struggle to live .
and in a way that &apos;s a metaphor for life .
b@@ j : so every moment it &apos;s on the stage , it &apos;s making the struggle .
so we call this a piece of emotional engineering that uses up@@ -@@ to-@@ the-@@ minute 17@@ th century technology -- to turn no@@ uns into ver@@ bs .
ak : well actually i pre@@ fer to say that it &apos;s an object constru@@ cted out of wood and cl@@ oth with movement built into it to per@@ su@@ ade you to believe that it has life .
ak : it has e@@ ars that move passi@@ vely when the head goes .
b@@ j : and it has these bul@@ k@@ heads made out of pl@@ y@@ wood , covered with fabri@@ c -- curi@@ ously similar , in fact , to the pl@@ y@@ wood can@@ o@@ es that ad@@ ri@@ an &apos;s father used to make when he was a boy in their work@@ shop .
and when we met at art school and fell in love in 197@@ 1 , i hat@@ ed pu@@ p@@ pe@@ ts .
and , in fact , it took about 10 years to discover the b@@ am@@ bar@@ a b@@ am@@ ana pu@@ p@@ pe@@ ts of mal@@ i in west africa , where there &apos;s a fab@@ ul@@ ous tradition of pu@@ p@@ pe@@ try , to learn a rene@@ wed , or a new , respect for this art form .
ak : so in 198@@ 1 , i per@@ su@@ aded bas@@ il and some friends of mine to form a pu@@ p@@ pet company .
and 20 years later , mira@@ cul@@ ously , we collabor@@ ated with a company from mal@@ i , the so@@ gol@@ on mar@@ i@@ on@@ ette trou@@ pe of ba@@ ma@@ ko , where we made a piece about a t@@ all gi@@ ra@@ ffe .
it was just called &quot; t@@ all horse , &quot; which was a life@@ -@@ si@@ zed gi@@ ra@@ ffe .
the bul@@ k@@ heads have now turned into ho@@ ops of can@@ e , but it &apos;s ultimately the same structure .
ak : the person in the h@@ ind legs is also controll@@ ing the tail , a bit like the hy@@ en@@ a -- same mechan@@ ism , just a bit bigger .
and he &apos;s controll@@ ing the ear movement .
b@@ j : so this production was seen by tom mor@@ r@@ is of the national the@@ at@@ re in london .
and just around that time , his mother had said , &quot; have you seen this book by michael mor@@ pur@@ go called &apos; war horse &apos; ? &quot;
ak : it &apos;s about a boy who falls in love with a horse .
the horse is sold to the first world war , and he jo@@ ins up to find his horse .
b@@ j : so tom gave us a call and said , &quot; do you think you could make us a horse for a show to happen at the national the@@ at@@ re ? &quot;
ak : it seemed a lo@@ vely idea .
b@@ j : but it had to ride . it had to have a ri@@ der .
a play about early 20th century plo@@ wing technology and ca@@ val@@ ry char@@ ges was a little bit of a challenge for the accoun@@ ting department at the national the@@ at@@ re in london .
so we began with a test .
b@@ j : this is ad@@ ri@@ an and th@@ ys stan@@ der , who went on to actually design the can@@ e system for the horse , and our ne@@ x@@ t-@@ door neighb@@ or ka@@ ther@@ ine , ri@@ ding on a la@@ d@@ der .
the weight is really difficult when it &apos;s up above your head .
so we made a model .
this is a car@@ d@@ board model , a little bit smaller than the hy@@ en@@ a .
you &apos;ll notice that the legs are pl@@ y@@ wood legs and the can@@ o@@ e structure is still there .
b@@ j : and the two mani@@ pul@@ ators are inside .
ak : we started work on the prototyp@@ e after the model was appro@@ ved , and the prototyp@@ e took a bit longer than we anti@@ ci@@ p@@ ated .
and we had a cra@@ te built for it .
it had to be shi@@ pped to london .
we were going to te@@ st-@@ drive it on the street outside of our house in cape town , and it got to mid@@ night and we hadn &apos;t done that yet .
b@@ j : so we got a camera , and we posed the pu@@ p@@ pet in various gal@@ lo@@ ping stances .
and we sent it off to the national the@@ at@@ re , hop@@ ing that they believed that we created something that worked .
ak : a month later , we were there in london with this big box and a studio full of people about to work with us .
b@@ j : about 40 people .
ak : we were terri@@ fied .
we opened the li@@ d , we took the horse out , and it did work ; it walked and it was able to be ri@@ dden .
here i have an 18@@ -@@ second clip of the very first walk of the prototyp@@ e .
this is in the national the@@ at@@ re studio , the place where they co@@ ok new ideas .
it had by no means got the green light yet .
the ch@@ ore@@ ograph@@ er , to@@ by se@@ d@@ g@@ wi@@ ck , invented a beautiful sequence where the baby horse , which was made out of sti@@ cks and bits of twi@@ gs , grew up into the big horse .
and ni@@ ck star@@ r , the director of the national the@@ at@@ re , saw that particular moment , he was standing next to me -- he nearly we@@ t himself .
and so the show was given the green light .
and we went back to cape town and re@@ designed the horse completely .
here is the plan .
and here is our factory in cape town where we make hor@@ ses .
the hor@@ ses are completely hand@@ made .
but because they have to be light and flexi@@ ble , and each one of them is different , they can &apos;t be mas@@ s-@@ produced , unfortunately .
so here are some hal@@ f-@@ finished hor@@ ses ready to be worked in london .
jo@@ ey boy , you there ?
jo@@ ey .
jo@@ ey .
jo@@ ey , come here .
no , no , i haven &apos;t got it .
come here . stand here where people can see you .
move around . come on .
i &apos;d just like to describe -- i won &apos;t talk too l@@ oud . he might get ir@@ ri@@ t@@ ated .
here , cra@@ ig is working the head .
he has bi@@ cycle bra@@ ke c@@ ables going down to the head control in his hand .
each one of them oper@@ ates either an ear , separ@@ ately , or the head , up and down .
but he also contro@@ ls the head directly by using his hand .
the e@@ ars are obviously a very important emotional indi@@ c@@ ator of the horse .
when they point right back , the horse is fe@@ ar@@ ful or an@@ gry , depen@@ ding upon what &apos;s going on in front of him , around him .
or , when he &apos;s more rela@@ x@@ ed , the head comes down and the e@@ ars listen , either side .
hor@@ ses &apos; hearing is very important .
it &apos;s almost more important than their e@@ y@@ es@@ ight .
over here , tom@@ my &apos;s got what you call the heart position .
he &apos;s working the leg .
you see the string ten@@ don from the hy@@ en@@ a , the hy@@ en@@ a &apos;s front leg , auto@@ matically pul@@ ls the ho@@ op up .
hor@@ ses are so un@@ predic@@ table .
the way a ho@@ of comes up with a horse immediately gives you the feeling that it &apos;s a convin@@ cing horse action .
and together , there &apos;s quite a complex possibility of tail expression .
ad@@ ri@@ an thought that he was going to have to spli@@ t the ch@@ est of the pu@@ p@@ pet in two and make it brea@@ the like that -- because that &apos;s how a horse would brea@@ the , with an exp@@ and@@ ed ch@@ est .
so he made a chan@@ nel in here , and the ch@@ est moves up and down in that chan@@ nel .
so it &apos;s anti-@@ natur@@ ali@@ stic really , the up and down movement , but it feels like breath .
and it &apos;s very , very simple because all that happens is that the pu@@ p@@ pe@@ te@@ er brea@@ th@@ es with his k@@ ne@@ es .
if i were to touch the horse here on his skin , the heart pu@@ p@@ pe@@ te@@ er can sha@@ ke the body from inside and get the skin to qui@@ ver .
and i would like you to believe that it was an a@@ es@@ thetic choice , that i was making a three-@@ dimensional drawing of a horse that somehow moves in space .
the skin itself is made out of a se@@ e-@@ through n@@ yl@@ on mes@@ h , which , if the ligh@@ ting designer wants the horse to almost disappe@@ ar , she can light the background and the horse becomes g@@ ho@@ st@@ like .
you see the skelet@@ al structure of it .
or if you light it from above , it becomes more soli@@ d .
again , that was a practical consi@@ der@@ ation .
the guys inside the horse have to be able to see out .
they have to be able to act and it &apos;s very much an in-@@ the-@@ moment activity that they &apos;re enga@@ ged in .
it &apos;s three heads making one character .
but now we would like you to put jo@@ ey through some pac@@ es .
and plant .
thank you .
and now just -- all the way from sun@@ ny california we have z@@ em jo@@ a@@ qu@@ in who &apos;s going to ride the horse for us .
so we would like to stress that the performance you see in the horse is three guys who have studied horse behavior incredibly th@@ or@@ ough@@ ly .
b@@ j : not being able to talk to one another while they &apos;re on@@ stage because they &apos;re mic &apos;d .
the sound that that very large ch@@ est makes , of the horse -- the wh@@ inn@@ ying and the ni@@ ck@@ ering and everything -- that starts usually with one perfor@@ mer , car@@ ries on with a second person and ends with a third .
ak : mi@@ key bre@@ tt from lei@@ ce@@ ster@@ shi@@ re .
thank you . thank you .
hand@@ spring pu@@ p@@ pet co . : the geni@@ us pu@@ p@@ pe@@ try behind war horse
&quot; pu@@ p@@ pe@@ ts always have to try to be alive , &quot; says ad@@ ri@@ an ko@@ hl@@ er of the hand@@ spring pu@@ p@@ pet company , a gl@@ ori@@ ously ambi@@ tious trou@@ pe of human and woo@@ den ac@@ tors . beginning with the tale of a hy@@ en@@ a &apos;s sub@@ tle pa@@ w , pu@@ p@@ pe@@ te@@ ers ko@@ hl@@ er and bas@@ il j@@ ones build to the story of their lat@@ est ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ment : the wonder@@ fully life@@ -@@ like jo@@ ey , the war horse , who tro@@ ts convin@@ c@@ ingly onto the stage .
let &apos;s start with day and night .
life evolved under conditions of light and dar@@ k@@ ness , light and then dar@@ k@@ ness .
and so plants and animals developed their own intern@@ al clo@@ cks so that they would be ready for these changes in light .
these are chemical clo@@ cks , and they &apos;re found in every known being that has two or more cells and in some that only have one cell .
i &apos;ll give you an example -- if you take a hor@@ s@@ es@@ ho@@ e cra@@ b off the beach , and you fly it all the way across the continent , and you drop it into a slo@@ ped c@@ age , it will sc@@ ra@@ m@@ ble up the floor of the c@@ age as the ti@@ de is ris@@ ing on its home shor@@ es , and it &apos;ll sk@@ it@@ ter down again right as the water is re@@ ce@@ ding thousands of miles away .
it &apos;ll do this for weeks , until it kind of gradu@@ ally lo@@ ses the p@@ lot .
and it &apos;s incredible to watch , but there &apos;s nothing psych@@ ic or par@@ an@@ or@@ mal going on ; it &apos;s simply that these cr@@ ab@@ s have intern@@ al cy@@ cles that cor@@ respond , usually , with what &apos;s going on around it .
so , we have this ability as well .
and in humans , we call it the &quot; body clock . &quot;
you can see this most clearly when you take away someone &apos;s watch and you shu@@ t them into a bun@@ ker , deep under@@ ground , for a couple of months .
people actually volunte@@ er for this , and they usually come out kind of ra@@ ving about their productive time in the hole .
so , no matter how at@@ yp@@ ical these subje@@ cts would have to be , they all show the same thing .
they get up just a little bit later every day -- say 15 minutes or so -- and they kind of dri@@ ft all the way around the clock like this over the course of the weeks .
and so , in this way we know that they are working on their own intern@@ al clo@@ cks , rather than somehow sen@@ sing the day outside .
so fine , we have a body clock , and it turns out that it &apos;s incredibly important in our lives .
it &apos;s a huge driver for culture and i think that it &apos;s the most under@@ r@@ ated force on our behavior .
we evolved as a species near the equ@@ ator , and so we &apos;re very well-@@ equi@@ pped to deal with 12 hours of da@@ y@@ light and 12 hours of dar@@ k@@ ness .
but of course , we &apos;ve spread to every corner of the glo@@ be and in arc@@ tic canada , where i live , we have per@@ pe@@ tual da@@ y@@ light in summer and 24 hours of dar@@ k@@ ness in winter .
so the culture , the northern ab@@ original culture , tradition@@ ally has been highly seas@@ onal .
and in summer , it &apos;s almost man@@ ic hun@@ ting and working activity very long hours , very active .
so , what would our natural rhyth@@ m look like ?
well , it turns out that when people are living without any sort of artificial light at all , they sleep twice every night .
they go to bed around 8 : 00 p@@ .@@ m .
until mid@@ night and then again , they sleep from about 2 : 00 a@@ .@@ m@@ . until sun@@ rise .
and in-@@ between , they have a couple of hours of sort of medi@@ ta@@ tive quie@@ t in bed .
and during this time , there &apos;s a sur@@ ge of pro@@ l@@ ac@@ tin , the li@@ kes of which a modern day never sees .
the people in these studies report feeling so a@@ wake during the da@@ y@@ time , that they realize they &apos;re experi@@ en@@ cing true wa@@ ke@@ ful@@ ness for the first time in their lives .
so , cut to the modern day .
we &apos;re living in a culture of je@@ t lag , global travel , 24@@ -@@ hour business , shift work .
and you know , our modern ways of doing things have their advan@@ tages , but i believe we should understand the costs .
thank you .
j@@ ess@@ a gam@@ ble : our natural sleep cycle
in today &apos;s world , bal@@ an@@ cing school , work , kids and more , most of us can only hope for the re@@ com@@ men@@ ded eight hours of sleep . exam@@ ining the science behind our body &apos;s intern@@ al clock , j@@ ess@@ a gam@@ ble reve@@ als the surprising and substan@@ tial program of rest we should be obser@@ ving .
i want to help you re-@@ percei@@ ve what phil@@ anth@@ rop@@ y is , what it could be , and what your relationship to it is .
and in doing that , i want to offer you a vision , an imag@@ ined future , if you will , of how , as the po@@ et se@@ am@@ us he@@ an@@ ey has put it , &quot; once in a lifetime the lon@@ ge@@ d-@@ for ti@@ d@@ al wave of justice can rise up , and hope and history rhy@@ me . &quot;
i want to start with these word pa@@ irs here .
we all know which side of these we &apos;d like to be on .
when phil@@ anth@@ rop@@ y was rein@@ v@@ ented a century ago , when the foundation form was actually invented , they didn &apos;t think of themselves on the wrong side of these either .
in fact they would never have thought of themselves as closed and set in their ways , as slow to respond to new challenges , as small and ris@@ k-@@ a@@ verse .
and in fact they weren &apos;t . they were rein@@ vent@@ ing char@@ ity in those times , what rock@@ ef@@ eller called &quot; the business of ben@@ evol@@ ence . &quot;
but by the end of the 20th century , a new generation of cri@@ tics and re@@ form@@ ers had come to see phil@@ anth@@ rop@@ y just this way .
this entrepr@@ en@@ eu@@ ri@@ al energy is emerging from many quar@@ ters .
and it &apos;s driven and prop@@ ell@@ ed forward by new leaders , like many of the people here , by new tools , like the ones we &apos;ve seen here , and by new pres@@ sur@@ es .
i &apos;ve been following this change for quite a while now , and partici@@ p@@ ating in it .
this report is our main public report .
what it tells is the story of how today actually could be as histor@@ ic as 100 years ago .
what i want to do is share some of the cool@@ est things that are going on with you .
and as i do that , i &apos;m not going to d@@ well much on the very large phil@@ anth@@ rop@@ y that everybody already knows about -- the gates or the sor@@ os or the google .
instead , what i want to do is talk about the phil@@ anth@@ rop@@ y of all of us : the democra@@ ti@@ zation of phil@@ anth@@ rop@@ y .
this is a moment in history when the average person has more power than at any time .
what i &apos;m going to do is look at five categ@@ ories of experiments , each of which challenges an old assu@@ mption of phil@@ anth@@ rop@@ y .
the first is mass collaboration , repres@@ ented here by wikipedia .
now , this may surprise you .
but remember , phil@@ anth@@ rop@@ y is about giving of time and talent , not just money .
clay shir@@ ky , that great chron@@ ic@@ ler of everything net@@ worked , has cap@@ tured the assu@@ mption that this challenges in such a beautiful way .
he said , &quot; we have lived in this world where little things are done for love and big things for money .
now we have wikipedia .
suddenly big things can be done for love . &quot;
watch , this spring , for paul haw@@ ken &apos;s new book -- auth@@ or and entrepr@@ en@@ eu@@ r many of you may know about .
the book is called &quot; bl@@ essed un@@ rest . &quot;
and when it comes out , a series of wi@@ ki sites under the lab@@ el wis@@ er , are going to laun@@ ch at the same time .
wis@@ er stands for world inde@@ x for social and environmental responsibility .
wis@@ er sets out to docum@@ ent , link and em@@ power what paul calls the largest movement , and fa@@ ste@@ st-@@ growing movement in human history : humanity &apos;s collective imm@@ une response to today &apos;s thre@@ ats .
but the ones that do are going to be the biggest , the most open , the fa@@ st@@ est , the most connected form of phil@@ anth@@ rop@@ y in human history .
this is , of course , to phil@@ anth@@ rop@@ y what e@@ bay and ama@@ zon are to commer@@ ce .
think of it as pe@@ er-@@ to-@@ pe@@ er phil@@ anth@@ rop@@ y .
and this challenges yet another assu@@ mption , which is that organized phil@@ anth@@ rop@@ y is only for the very weal@@ thy .
take a look , if you haven &apos;t , at don@@ or@@ scho@@ o@@ se .
om@@ i@@ dy@@ ar network has made a big investment in don@@ or@@ scho@@ o@@ se .
it &apos;s one of the best known of these new market@@ places where a don@@ or can go straight into a classroom and connect with what a teacher says they need .
take a look at changing the present , started by a ted@@ ster , next time you need a we@@ d@@ ding present or a ho@@ li@@ day present .
gi@@ v@@ ein@@ dia is for a whole country .
and it goes on and on .
the third categ@@ ory is repres@@ ented by war@@ ren bu@@ ff@@ et , which i call ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ated giving .
it &apos;s not just that war@@ ren bu@@ ff@@ et was so ama@@ z@@ ingly gener@@ ous in that histor@@ ic act last summer .
it &apos;s that he challen@@ ged another assu@@ mption , that every gi@@ ver should have his or her own fund or foundation .
there are now , today , so many new fun@@ ds that are ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ating giving and invest@@ ing , bringing together people around a common goal , to think bigger .
one of the best known is ac@@ u@@ men fund , led by jac@@ qu@@ eline no@@ vo@@ gr@@ atz , a ted@@ ster who got a big boo@@ st here at ted .
but there are many others : new profit in cambridge , new school &apos;s vent@@ ure fund in silicon valley , vent@@ ure phil@@ anth@@ rop@@ y part@@ ners in washington , global fund for women in san francisco .
take a look at these .
these fun@@ ds are to phil@@ anth@@ rop@@ y what vent@@ ure capital , private equ@@ ity , and eventually mu@@ tual fun@@ ds are to invest@@ ing , but with a twi@@ st -- because often a community forms around these fun@@ ds , as it has at ac@@ u@@ men and other places .
now , imagine for a second these first three types of experiments : mass collaboration , online market@@ places , ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ated giving .
and understand how they help us re-@@ percei@@ ve what organized phil@@ anth@@ rop@@ y is .
it &apos;s not about foun@@ da@@ tions necessarily ; it &apos;s about the rest of us .
and imagine the ma@@ sh@@ -up , if you will , of these things , in the future , when these things come together in the experiments of the future -- imagine that somebody puts up , say , 100 million dollars for an in@@ spir@@ ing goal -- there were 21 gif@@ ts of 100 million dollars or more in the us last year , not out of the question -- but only puts it up if it &apos;s mat@@ ched by millions of small gif@@ ts from around the glo@@ be , there@@ by eng@@ aging lots of people , and building visi@@ bility and eng@@ aging people in the goal that &apos;s st@@ ated .
they &apos;re be@@ tting a visible competition , a prize , can attra@@ ct talent and money to some of the most difficult issues , and there@@ by speed the solution .
this tac@@ kl@@ es yet another assu@@ mption , that the gi@@ ver and the organization is at the center , as op@@ posed to putting the problem at the center .
you can look to these inno@@ v@@ ators to help us especially with things that require technologi@@ cal or scientific solution .
that leaves the final categ@@ ory , social invest@@ ing , which is really , anyway , the biggest of them all , repres@@ ented here by xi@@ gi@@ .@@ net .
and this , of course , tac@@ kl@@ es the biggest assu@@ mption of all , that business is business , and phil@@ anth@@ rop@@ y is the vehicle of people who want to create change in the world .
x@@ ig@@ i is a new community site that &apos;s built by the community , lin@@ king and ma@@ pping this new social capital market .
it li@@ sts already 1,000 enti@@ ties that are off@@ ering de@@ bt and equ@@ ity for social enter@@ prise .
so we can look to these inno@@ v@@ ators to help us remember that if we can le@@ verage even a small amount of the capital that see@@ ks a return , the good that can be driven could be ast@@ on@@ ishing .
now , what &apos;s really interesting here is that we &apos;re not thinking our way into a new way of acting ; we &apos;re acting our way into a new way of thinking .
phil@@ anth@@ rop@@ y is re@@ organi@@ zing itself before our very eyes .
and even though all of the experiments and all of the big gi@@ vers don &apos;t yet ful@@ fill this as@@ pi@@ ration , i think this is the new zeit@@ geist : open , big , fast , connected , and , let us also hope , long .
we have got to realize that it is going to take a long time to do these things .
if we don &apos;t develop the stam@@ ina to stick with things -- whatever it is you pick , stick with it -- all of this stuff is just going to be , you know , a fa@@ d .
but i &apos;m really hop@@ e@@ ful .
and i &apos;m hop@@ e@@ ful because it &apos;s not only phil@@ anth@@ rop@@ y that &apos;s re@@ organi@@ zing itself , it &apos;s also whole other por@@ tions of the social sector , and of business , that are bus@@ y challen@@ ging &quot; business as usual . &quot;
and everywhere i go , including here at ted , i feel that there is a new moral hunger that is growing .
what we &apos;re seeing is people really w@@ rest@@ ling to describe what is this new thing that &apos;s happening .
words like &quot; phil@@ anthro@@ capit@@ alism , &quot; and &quot; natural capit@@ alism , &quot; and &quot; phil@@ anthro@@ entrepr@@ en@@ eu@@ r , &quot; and &quot; vent@@ ure phil@@ anth@@ rop@@ y . &quot;
we don &apos;t have a language for it yet .
whatever we call it , it &apos;s new , it &apos;s beginning , and i think it &apos;s g@@ ong to quite significant .
and that &apos;s where my imag@@ ined future comes in , which i am going to call the social sing@@ ul@@ ar@@ ity .
many of you will realize that i &apos;m ri@@ pping a bit off of the science fi@@ ction writer ver@@ nor vin@@ ge &apos;s notion of a technologi@@ cal sing@@ ul@@ ar@@ ity , where a number of trends acceler@@ ate and conver@@ ge and come together to create , really , a sho@@ ck@@ ingly new reality .
that &apos;s because our ability to con@@ front the problems that we face has not kept p@@ ace with our ability to create them .
and as we &apos;ve heard here , it is no ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ation to say that we hold the future of our civilization in our hands as never before .
the question is , is there a positive social sing@@ ul@@ ar@@ ity ?
is there a fron@@ tier for us of how we live together ?
our future doesn &apos;t have to be imag@@ ined .
we can create a future where hope and history rhy@@ me .
but we have a problem .
our experience to date , both individu@@ ally and colle@@ c@@ tively , hasn &apos;t prepared us for what we &apos;re going to need to do , or who we &apos;re going to need to be .
we are going to need a new generation of citi@@ zen leaders willing to com@@ mit ourselves to growing and changing and learning as rapi@@ dly as possible .
that &apos;s why i have one last thing i want to show you .
this is a photograph taken about 100 years ago of my grand@@ father and great@@ -@@ grand@@ father .
this is a newspaper publi@@ sh@@ er and a ban@@ ker .
and they were great community leaders .
and , yes , they were great phil@@ anthro@@ pi@@ sts .
i keep this photograph close by to me -- it &apos;s in my office -- because i &apos;ve always felt a my@@ sti@@ cal connection to these two men , both of whom i never knew .
and so , in their honor , i want to offer you this blan@@ k slide .
and i want you to imagine that this a photograph of you .
and i want you to think about the community that you want to be part of creating .
whatever that means to you .
and i want you to imagine that it &apos;s 100 years from now , and your grand@@ child , or great@@ -@@ grand@@ child , or nie@@ ce or ne@@ p@@ he@@ w or go@@ d-@@ child , is looking at this photograph of you .
ka@@ ther@@ ine ful@@ ton : you are the future of phil@@ anth@@ rop@@ y
in this u@@ pli@@ f@@ ting talk , ka@@ ther@@ ine ful@@ ton sk@@ et@@ ches the new future of phil@@ anth@@ rop@@ y -- one where collaboration and innovation allow regular people to do big things , even when money is sc@@ ar@@ ce . giving five practical examples of crow@@ d-@@ driven phil@@ anth@@ rop@@ y , she calls for a new generation of citi@@ zen leaders .
and something that i see happening is something that i would like to call a sort of &quot; democra@@ ti@@ zation of inti@@ ma@@ cy . &quot;
and what do i mean by that ?
i mean that what people are doing is , in fact , they are sort of , with their communication chan@@ n@@ els , they are breaking an im@@ posed isol@@ ation that these institutions are im@@ pos@@ ing on them .
how are they doing this ? they &apos;re doing it in a very simple way , by calling their mom from work , by im@@ ing from their office to their friends , by tex@@ ting under the des@@ k .
the pictures that you &apos;re seeing behind me are people that i vis@@ ited in the last few months .
and i asked them to come along with the person they communicate with most .
and somebody brought a bo@@ y@@ friend , somebody a father .
one young woman brought her grand@@ father .
for 20 years , i &apos;ve been looking at how people use chan@@ n@@ els such as email , the mobile phone , tex@@ ting , etc .
what we &apos;re actually going to see is that , fundament@@ ally , people are communic@@ ating on a regular basis with five , six , seven of their most inti@@ mate sphere .
now , lets take some data . facebook .
recently some soci@@ ologists from facebook -- facebook is the chan@@ nel that you would expect is the most en@@ lar@@ gen@@ ing of all chan@@ n@@ els .
and an average user , said c@@ amer@@ on mar@@ low , from facebook , has about 120 friends .
but he actually talks to , has two-@@ way ex@@ changes with , about four to six people on a regular base , depen@@ ding on his gender .
acade@@ mic research on inst@@ ant mes@@ sa@@ ging also shows 100 people on bud@@ dy li@@ sts , but fundament@@ ally people ch@@ at with two , three , four -- anyway , less than five .
my own research on cell@@ phones and voice calls shows that 80 percent of the calls are actually made to four people . 80 percent .
and when you go to sk@@ yp@@ e , it &apos;s down to two people .
a lot of soci@@ ologists actually are quite dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted .
i mean , i &apos;ve been a bit dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted sometimes when i saw this data and all this de@@ plo@@ y@@ ment , just for five people .
and some soci@@ ologists actually feel that it &apos;s a clo@@ sure , it &apos;s a co@@ co@@ oning , that we &apos;re dis@@ eng@@ aging from the public .
and i would actually , i would like to show you that if we actually look at who is doing it , and from where they &apos;re doing it , actually there is an incredible social transformation .
there are three stories that i think are quite good examples .
and so he starts working every morning at four o &apos;@@ clock in the morning .
and around eight o &apos;@@ clock he sort of s@@ ne@@ a@@ ks away from his o@@ ven , cle@@ ans his hands from the fl@@ our and calls his wife .
he just wants to wish her a good day , because that &apos;s the start of her day .
and i &apos;ve heard this story a number of times .
a young factory wor@@ ker who works night shif@@ ts , who man@@ ages to s@@ ne@@ ak away from the factory floor , where there is c@@ c@@ tv by the way , and find a corner , where at 11 o &apos;@@ clock at night he can call his gir@@ l@@ friend and just say go@@ od@@ night .
or a mother who , at four o &apos;@@ clock , suddenly man@@ ages to find a corner in the toi@@ let to check that her children are sa@@ f@@ ely home .
then there is another couple , there is a brazi@@ li@@ an couple .
they &apos;ve lived in it@@ al@@ y for a number of years .
they sk@@ yp@@ e with their families a few times a week .
but once a fort@@ night , they actually put the computer on their din@@ ing table , pull out the web@@ c@@ am and actually have dinner with their family in sa@@ o pau@@ l@@ o . and they have a big event of it .
and i heard this story the first time a couple of years ago from a very mo@@ dest family of im@@ migr@@ ants from ko@@ so@@ vo in swi@@ tz@@ er@@ land .
they had set up a big screen in their living room , and every morning they had break@@ fast with their grandmother .
but dan@@ ny mil@@ ler , who is a very good anthropo@@ log@@ ist who is working on fi@@ li@@ p@@ ina migr@@ ant women who leave their children back in the phili@@ pp@@ ines , was telling me about how much par@@ enting is going on through sk@@ yp@@ e , and how much these mothers are enga@@ ged with their children through sk@@ yp@@ e .
and then there is the third couple . they are two friends .
they ch@@ at to each other every day , a few times a day actually .
and finally , finally , they &apos;ve managed to put inst@@ ant mes@@ sa@@ ging on their computers at work .
and now , obviously , they have it open .
whenever they have a moment they ch@@ at to each other .
and this is exactly what we &apos;ve been seeing with teen@@ a@@ gers and kids doing it in school , under the table , and tex@@ ting under the table to their friends .
so , none of these cases are unique .
i mean , i could tell you hundreds of them .
but what is really ex@@ cep@@ tional is the setting .
but it could be in a school , it could be an admini@@ stration , it could be a hospital .
three sett@@ ings that , if we just step back 15 years , if you just think back 15 years , when you clo@@ cked in , when you clo@@ cked in to an office , when you clo@@ cked in to a factory , there was no contact for the whole du@@ ration of the time , there was no contact with your private sphere .
if you were lucky there was a public phone han@@ ging in the cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or or somewhere .
if you were in management , oh , that was a different story .
maybe you had a direct line .
if you were not , you maybe had to go through an oper@@ ator .
but basically , when you walked into those buildings , the private sphere was left behind you .
and this has become such a nor@@ m of our professional lives , such a nor@@ m and such an expec@@ tation .
and it had nothing to do with technical cap@@ ability .
the phones were there . but the expec@@ tation was once you moved in there your commit@@ ment was fully to the task at hand , fully to the people around you .
that was where the focus had to be .
and this has become such a cultural nor@@ m that we actually school our children for them to be capable to do this c@@ lea@@ v@@ age .
if you think nur@@ ser@@ y , kinder@@ garten , first years of school are just de@@ dic@@ ated to take away the children , to make them used to sta@@ ying long hours away from their family .
and then the school en@@ acts perfectly well .
it mi@@ mi@@ cs perfectly all the ritu@@ als that we will find in off@@ ices : ritu@@ als of ent@@ ry , ritu@@ als of ex@@ it , the sch@@ ed@@ ul@@ es , the uni@@ forms in this country , things that identify you , te@@ am@@ -@@ building activi@@ ties , team building that will allow you to basically be with a random group of kids , or a random group of people that you will have to be with for a number of time .
and of course , the major thing : learn to pay attention , to concent@@ rate and focus your attention .
this only started about 150 years ago .
it only started with the birth of modern bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ cy , and of industrial revolution .
when people basically had to go somewhere else to work and carry out the work .
and when with modern bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ cy there was a very rational approach , where there was a clear distin@@ ction between the private sphere and the public sphere .
so , until then , basically people were living on top of their tra@@ des .
they were living on top of the land they were labor@@ ing .
and if you think , it &apos;s per@@ me@@ ated our whole culture , even our cities .
if you think of medi@@ ev@@ al cities , medi@@ ev@@ al cities the bor@@ ough@@ s all have the names of the gu@@ il@@ ds and professi@@ ons that lived there .
now we have spra@@ w@@ ling res@@ identi@@ al sub@@ ur@@ bi@@ as that are well distin@@ ct from production areas and commercial areas .
and actually , over these 150 years , there has been a very clear class system that also has emer@@ ged .
so the lower the status of the job and of the person carrying out , the more re@@ moved he would be from his personal sphere .
people have taken this amazing possibility of actually being in contact all through the day or in all types of situations .
and they are doing it massi@@ vely .
the pe@@ w institute , which produ@@ ces good data on a regular basis on , for instance , in the states , says that -- and i think that this number is conser@@ va@@ tive -- 50 percent of anybody with email access at work is actually doing private email from his office .
i really think that the number is conser@@ va@@ tive .
in my own research , we saw that the peak for private email is actually 11 o &apos;@@ clock in the morning , whatever the country .
75 percent of people ad@@ mit doing private conver@@ sa@@ tions from work on their mobile phones .
100 percent are using text .
the point is that this re-@@ appropri@@ ation of the personal sphere is not terri@@ bly successful with all institutions .
i &apos;m always surprised the u.s. army soci@@ ologists are discus@@ sing of the impact for instance , of soldiers in iraq having daily contact with their families .
but there are many institutions that are actually blo@@ cking this access .
and every day , every single day , i read news that makes me cr@@ inge , like a $ 15 fine to kids in texas , for using , every time they take out their mobile phone in school .
immedi@@ ate dis@@ mis@@ sal to bus dri@@ vers in new york , if seen with a mobile phone in a hand .
companies blo@@ cking access to im or to facebook .
behind issues of security and safety , which have always been the argu@@ ments for social control , in fact what is going on is that these institutions are trying to decide who , in fact , has a right to self deter@@ mine their attention , to decide , whether they should , or not , be isol@@ ated .
and they are actually trying to block , in a certain sense , this movement of a greater possibility of inti@@ ma@@ cy .
ste@@ fan@@ a broad@@ b@@ ent : how the internet en@@ ables inti@@ ma@@ cy
we worry that im , tex@@ ting , facebook are spo@@ il@@ ing human inti@@ ma@@ cy , but ste@@ fan@@ a broad@@ b@@ ent &apos;s research shows how communication tech is capable of cul@@ tiv@@ ating deeper relationships , bringing love across barri@@ ers like distance and work@@ place rules .
maybe you &apos;re out on the road for a long day , and you just wanted to get home .
you were ti@@ red , but you felt you could drive a few more miles .
maybe you thought , i &apos;ve had less to drink than everybody else , i should be the one to go home .
or maybe your mind was just entirely el@@ se@@ where .
does this sound familiar to you ?
now , in those situations , wouldn &apos;t it be great if there was a butt@@ on on your das@@ h@@ board that you could push , and the car would get you home sa@@ f@@ ely ?
now , that &apos;s been the promise of the self-@@ driving car , the autonom@@ ous vehicle , and it &apos;s been the dream since at least 193@@ 9 , when general mot@@ ors sho@@ w@@ cas@@ ed this idea at their fu@@ tu@@ ra@@ ma bo@@ oth at the world &apos;s fair .
now , it &apos;s been one of those dreams that &apos;s always seemed about 20 years in the future .
now , two weeks ago , that dream took a step forward , when the state of ne@@ v@@ ada gran@@ ted google &apos;s self-@@ driving car the very first licen@@ se for an autonom@@ ous vehicle , clearly establi@@ sh@@ ing that it &apos;s legal for them to test it on the roads in ne@@ v@@ ada .
now , california &apos;s consi@@ der@@ ing similar leg@@ is@@ lation , and this would make sure that the autonom@@ ous car is not one of those things that has to stay in v@@ eg@@ as .
now , in my lab at stanford , we &apos;ve been working on autonom@@ ous cars too , but with a slightly different sp@@ in on things . you see , we &apos;ve been developing robo@@ tic race cars , cars that can actually push themselves to the very limit@@ s of physical performance .
now , why would we want to do such a thing ?
well , there &apos;s two really good reasons for this .
first , we believe that before people turn over control to an autonom@@ ous car , that autonom@@ ous car should be at least as good as the very best human dri@@ vers .
now , if you &apos;re like me , and the other 70 percent of the population who know that we are abo@@ ve-@@ average dri@@ vers , you understand that &apos;s a very high bar .
there &apos;s another reason as well .
just like race car dri@@ vers can use all of the fri@@ ction between the ti@@ re and the road , all of the car &apos;s cap@@ abilities to go as fast as possible , we want to use all of those cap@@ abilities to avoid any accident we can .
now , you may push the car to the limit@@ s not because you &apos;re driving too fast , but because you &apos;ve hit an ic@@ y pat@@ ch of road , conditions have changed .
in those situations , we want a car that is capable enough to avoid any accident that can physi@@ cally be avo@@ i@@ ded .
i must conf@@ ess , there &apos;s kind of a third motivation as well .
you see , i have a passion for ra@@ cing .
in the past , i &apos;ve been a race car ow@@ ner , a cre@@ w ch@@ ie@@ f and a driving co@@ ach , although maybe not at the level that you &apos;re currently expe@@ cting .
it &apos;s another one of those categ@@ ories where maybe there &apos;s not a lot of competition .
but this is p@@ 1 . it &apos;s an entirely stud@@ ent@@ -@@ built electric vehicle , which through using its re@@ ar-@@ whe@@ el drive and fron@@ t-@@ whe@@ el ste@@ er-@@ b@@ y-@@ wire can dri@@ ft around cor@@ ners .
it can get si@@ de@@ ways like a r@@ ally car driver , always able to take the ti@@ gh@@ test cur@@ ve , even on sli@@ p@@ per@@ y , changing sur@@ faces , never sp@@ inning out .
we &apos;ve also worked with vol@@ ks@@ wagen or@@ ac@@ le , on shel@@ ley , an autonom@@ ous race car that has ra@@ ced at 150 miles an hour through the bon@@ ne@@ ville s@@ alt fl@@ ats , gone around th@@ under@@ h@@ ill ra@@ ce@@ way park in the sun , the wind and the rain , and navi@@ g@@ ated the 15@@ 3 turns and 12@@ .@@ 4 miles of the pi@@ kes peak h@@ ill clim@@ b rou@@ te in color@@ a@@ do with nobody at the whe@@ el .
i guess it goes without saying that we &apos;ve had a lot of fun doing this .
but in fact , there &apos;s something else that we &apos;ve developed in the process of developing these autonom@@ ous cars .
we have developed a tremendous appreci@@ ation for the cap@@ abilities of human race car dri@@ vers .
as we &apos;ve looked at the question of how well do these cars per@@ form , we wanted to compare them to our human counter@@ parts .
and we discovered their human counter@@ parts are amazing .
now , we can take a map of a race track , we can take a mathematical model of a car , and with some i@@ ter@@ ation , we can actually find the fa@@ st@@ est way around that track .
we line that up with data that we record from a professional driver , and the res@@ em@@ blan@@ ce is absolutely remarkable .
yes , there are sub@@ tle differences here , but the human race car driver is able to go out and drive an ama@@ z@@ ingly fast line , without the benefit of an algorith@@ m that compar@@ es the tra@@ de-@@ off between going as fast as possible in this corner , and sha@@ ving a little bit of time off of the straight over here .
they &apos;re able to go out and consi@@ st@@ ently do this , pus@@ hing the car to the limit@@ s every single time .
it &apos;s extraordinary to watch .
you put them in a new car , and after a few la@@ ps , they &apos;ve found the fa@@ st@@ est line in that car , and they &apos;re off to the ra@@ ces .
it really makes you think , we &apos;d love to know what &apos;s going on inside their brain .
so as researchers , that &apos;s what we decided to find out .
we decided to instrument not only the car , but also the race car driver , to try to get a gli@@ mp@@ se into what was going on in their head as they were doing this .
now , this is dr. l@@ ene har@@ bot@@ t appl@@ ying electro@@ des to the head of john mor@@ ton .
john mor@@ ton is a former can@@ -@@ am and im@@ sa driver , who &apos;s also a class cham@@ pi@@ on at le man@@ s .
fantastic driver , and very willing to put up with graduate students and this sort of research .
she &apos;s putting electro@@ des on his head so that we can monit@@ or the electrical activity in john &apos;s brain as he ra@@ ces around the track .
however , neuro@@ scientists have identi@@ fied certain patterns that let us te@@ ase out some very important aspe@@ cts of this .
for instance , the re@@ sting brain ten@@ ds to generate a lot of al@@ ph@@ a waves .
in contr@@ ast , the@@ ta waves are associated with a lot of cognitive activity , like visual process@@ ing , things where the driver is thinking quite a bit .
now , we can measure this , and we can look at the relative power between the the@@ ta waves and the al@@ ph@@ a waves .
this gives us a measure of mental work@@ load , how much the driver is actually challen@@ ged cogni@@ tively at any point along the track .
now , we wanted to see if we could actually record this on the track , so we head@@ ed down south to la@@ g@@ un@@ a se@@ ca .
la@@ g@@ un@@ a se@@ ca is a le@@ gen@@ dar@@ y ra@@ ce@@ way about hal@@ f@@ way between sal@@ in@@ as and mon@@ ter@@ ey .
it has a cur@@ ve there called the cor@@ k@@ scre@@ w .
now , the cor@@ k@@ scre@@ w is a chic@@ an@@ e , followed by a quick ri@@ ght-@@ hand@@ ed turn as the road dro@@ ps three stories .
now , the strategy for driving this as expla@@ ined to me was , you a@@ im for the bush in the distance , and as the road falls away , you realize it was actually the top of a tree .
all right , so thanks to the re@@ v@@ s program at stanford , we were able to take john there and put him behind the whe@@ el of a 1960 por@@ sche ab@@ ar@@ th car@@ r@@ era .
life is way too short for bor@@ ing cars .
so , here you see john on the track , he &apos;s going up the h@@ ill -- oh ! somebody liked that -- and you can see , actually , his mental work@@ load -- meas@@ uring here in the red bar -- you can see his actions as he approach@@ es .
now watch , he has to down@@ shift .
look for the tree , and down .
not surpris@@ ingly , you can see this is a pretty challen@@ ging task .
you can see his mental work@@ load spi@@ ke as he goes through this , as you would expect with something that requires this level of complexity .
but what &apos;s really interesting is to look at areas of the track where his mental work@@ load doesn &apos;t increase .
i &apos;m going to take you around now to the other side of the track .
turn three . and john &apos;s going to go into that corner and the re@@ ar end of the car is going to begin to slide out .
he &apos;s going to have to cor@@ rect for that with ste@@ ering .
so watch as john does this here .
the car begins to slide out , dra@@ matic man@@ eu@@ ver to cor@@ rect it , and no change what@@ so@@ ever in the mental work@@ load .
not a challen@@ ging task .
in fact , entirely refle@@ xi@@ ve .
now , our data process@@ ing on this is still pre@@ li@@ min@@ ary , but it really seems that these phenomen@@ al fe@@ ats that the race car dri@@ vers are per@@ forming are instin@@ ctive .
they are things that they have simply learned to do .
it requires very little mental work@@ load for them to per@@ form these amazing fe@@ ats .
and their actions are fantastic .
this is exactly what you want to do on the ste@@ ering whe@@ el to catch the car in this situation .
now , this has given us tremendous insi@@ ght and inspiration for our own autonom@@ ous vehi@@ cles .
we &apos;ve started to ask the question : can we make them a little less algorith@@ mic and a little more intui@@ tive ?
can we take this refle@@ xi@@ ve action that we see from the very best race car dri@@ vers , introdu@@ ce it to our cars , and maybe even into a system that could get onto your car in the future ?
that would take us a long step along the road to autonom@@ ous vehi@@ cles that drive as well as the best humans .
but it &apos;s made us think a little bit more deeply as well .
do we want something more from our car than to simply be a ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ r ?
do we want our car to perhaps be a partner , a co@@ ach , someone that can use their understanding of the situation to help us reach our potential ?
can , in fact , the technology not simply replace humans , but allow us to reach the level of refle@@ x and intuition that we &apos;re all capable of ?
so , as we move forward into this technologi@@ cal future , i want you to just pause and think of that for a moment .
what is the ide@@ al balance of human and machine ?
and as we think about that , let &apos;s take inspiration from the absolutely amazing cap@@ abilities of the human body and the human mind .
thank you .
chris ger@@ des : the future race car -- 15@@ 0@@ mp@@ h , and no driver
autonom@@ ous cars are coming -- and they &apos;re going to drive better than you . chris ger@@ des reve@@ als how he and his team are developing robo@@ tic race cars that can drive at 150 mp@@ h while avo@@ i@@ ding every possible accident . and yet , in studying the bra@@ in@@ waves of professional ra@@ cing dri@@ vers , ger@@ des says he has ga@@ ined a new appreci@@ ation for the instin@@ cts of professional dri@@ vers . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
the first one is happening right here in chicago .
bren@@ da pal@@ m@@ s-@@ far@@ ber was hi@@ red to help ex@@ -@@ con@@ vi@@ cts re@@ enter society and keep them from going back into prison .
currently , tax@@ pa@@ yers spend about 6@@ 0,000 dollars per year sending a person to ja@@ il .
we know that two-@@ thir@@ ds of them are going to go back .
i find it interesting that , for every one dollar we spend , however , on early childhood education , like head start , we save 17 dollars on stuff like in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation in the future .
or -- think about it -- that 6@@ 0,000 dollars is more than what it costs to send one person to harvard as well .
but bren@@ da , not being ph@@ ased by stuff like that , took a look at her challenge and came up with a not@@ -@@ so-@@ obvious solution : create a business that produ@@ ces skin care products from hon@@ ey .
okay , it might be obvious to some of you ; it wasn &apos;t to me .
it &apos;s the basis of growing a form of social innovation that has real potential .
she hi@@ red seem@@ ingly un@@ emplo@@ y@@ able men and women to care for the bees , harv@@ est the hon@@ ey and make valu@@ e-@@ ad@@ ded products that they market@@ ed themselves , and that were later sold at whole fo@@ ods .
she combin@@ ed emplo@@ y@@ ment experience and training with life skills they needed , like an@@ ger@@ -@@ management and te@@ am@@ work , and also how to talk to future emplo@@ yers about how their experiences actually demon@@ strated the lessons that they had learned and their e@@ a@@ ger@@ ness to learn more .
less than four percent actually go back to ja@@ il .
so these young men and women learned job@@ -@@ read@@ iness and life skills through be@@ e keeping and became productive citizens in the process .
talk about a swe@@ et beginning .
now , i &apos;m going to take you to los angeles , and lots of people know that l@@ .@@ a. has its issues .
they have not enough water on most days and too much to hand@@ le when it ra@@ ins .
currently , 20 percent of california &apos;s energy consumption is used to pu@@ mp water into mostly southern california .
their spending lo@@ ads , lo@@ ads , to chan@@ nel that rain@@ water out into the ocean when it ra@@ ins and f@@ loo@@ ds as well .
now and@@ y li@@ p@@ k@@ is is working to help l@@ .@@ a. cut infrastructure costs associated with water management and urban heat island -- lin@@ king trees , people and technology to create a more li@@ vable city .
all that green stuff actually naturally absor@@ bs stor@@ m water , also helps cool our cities .
because , come to think about it , do you really want air@@ -@@ condi@@ tion@@ ing , or is it a cool@@ er room that you want ?
how you get it shouldn &apos;t make that much of a difference .
and and@@ y and his team discovered that they were going to spend 200 million of those dollars on as@@ p@@ halt to surro@@ und the schools themselves .
and by pres@@ enting a really strong economic case , they convinced the l@@ .@@ a. government that re@@ plac@@ ing that as@@ p@@ halt with trees and other gre@@ ener@@ y , that the schools themselves would save the system more on energy than they spend on hor@@ tic@@ ul@@ tural infrastructure .
so ultimately , 20 million square feet of as@@ p@@ halt was re@@ placed or avo@@ i@@ ded , and electrical consumption for air@@ -@@ condi@@ tion@@ ing went down , while emplo@@ y@@ ment for people to main@@ tain those gro@@ unds went up , resul@@ ting in a net@@ -@@ sav@@ ings to the system , but also heal@@ thi@@ er students and schools system employees as well .
now ju@@ dy bon@@ ds is a coal min@@ er &apos;s daughter .
her family has eight generations in a town called whit@@ es@@ ville , west virg@@ ini@@ a .
and if anyone should be cl@@ inging to the former gl@@ ory of the coal min@@ ing history , and of the town , it should be ju@@ dy .
but the way coal is min@@ ed right now is different from the deep min@@ es that her father and her father &apos;s father would go down into and that emplo@@ yed essentially thousands and thousands of people .
now , two do@@ zen men can te@@ ar down a mountain in several months , and only for about a few years &apos; worth of coal .
it can make a mountain go from this to this in a few short months .
just imagine that the air surro@@ unding these places -- it &apos;s filled with the resi@@ due of explo@@ si@@ ves and coal .
when we vis@@ ited , it gave some of the people we were with this strange little c@@ ough after being only there for just a few hours or so -- not just min@@ ers , but everybody .
and ju@@ dy saw her landscape being destro@@ yed and her water po@@ is@@ oned .
and the coal companies just move on after the mountain was emp@@ ti@@ ed , leaving even more un@@ emplo@@ y@@ ment in their wake .
but she also saw the difference in potential wind energy on an in@@ t@@ act mountain , and one that was re@@ duced in el@@ ev@@ ation by over 2,000 feet .
three years of dir@@ ty energy with not many jobs , or cent@@ u@@ ries of clean energy with the potential for developing exper@@ ti@@ se and impro@@ v@@ ements in efficiency based on technical skills , and developing local knowledge about how to get the most out of that region &apos;s wind .
she calcul@@ ated the up@@ -@@ front cost and the pay@@ back over time , and it &apos;s a net@@ -@@ plus on so many levels for the local , national and global economy .
it &apos;s a longer pay@@ back than moun@@ tain@@ top re@@ mov@@ al , but the wind energy actually pa@@ ys back forever .
now moun@@ tain@@ top re@@ mov@@ al pa@@ ys very little money to the lo@@ cals , and it gives them a lot of mis@@ ery .
the water is turned into go@@ o .
most people are still un@@ emplo@@ yed , leading to most of the same kinds of social problems that un@@ emplo@@ yed people in inner cities also experience -- drug and al@@ co@@ hol ab@@ use , dom@@ esti@@ c ab@@ use , te@@ en preg@@ nan@@ cy and poor he@@ ath , as well .
now ju@@ dy and i -- i have to say -- totally related to each other .
not quite an obvious alli@@ ance .
i mean , they are not -- they a@@ in &apos;t compe@@ ting for the birth@@ place of hi@@ p ho@@ p ti@@ tle or anything like that .
but the back of my t-@@ shir@@ t , the one that she gave me , says , &quot; save the en@@ danger@@ ed h@@ ill@@ billi@@ es . &quot;
so home@@ girls and h@@ ill@@ billi@@ es we got it together and totally understand that this is what it &apos;s all about .
but just a few months ago , ju@@ dy was diagno@@ sed with sta@@ ge-@@ three lung cancer .
yeah .
and it has since moved to her b@@ ones and her brain .
and i just find it so bizar@@ re that she &apos;s suffering from the same thing that she tried so hard to protect people from .
but her dream of coal river mountain wind is her leg@@ acy .
and she might not get to see that moun@@ tain@@ top .
but rather than writing yet some kind of mani@@ fest@@ o or something , she &apos;s leaving behind a business plan to make it happen .
that &apos;s what my home@@ girl is doing .
so i &apos;m so proud of that .
but these three people don &apos;t know each other , but they do have an awful lot in common .
they &apos;re all problem sol@@ vers , and they &apos;re just some of the many examples that i really am privi@@ le@@ ged to see , meet and learn from in the examples of the work that i do now .
i was really lucky to have them all fe@@ at@@ u@@ red on my corpo@@ ration for public radio radio show called the@@ promis@@ ed@@ land@@ .@@ or@@ g .
now they &apos;re all very practical visi@@ on@@ aries .
they take a look at the dem@@ ands that are out there -- beauty products , healthy schools , electricity -- and how the money &apos;s flo@@ wing to meet those dem@@ ands .
and when the che@@ ap@@ est solutions invol@@ ve re@@ duc@@ ing the number of jobs , you &apos;re left with un@@ emplo@@ yed people , and those people aren &apos;t cheap .
in fact , they make up some of what i call the most expensive citizens , and they inclu@@ de gener@@ a@@ tion@@ ally im@@ pover@@ ished , trau@@ mati@@ zed ve@@ ts re@@ turning from the middle east , people coming out of ja@@ il .
and for the veter@@ ans in particular , the v@@ .@@ a. said there &apos;s a si@@ x-@@ fold increase in mental health pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tic@@ als by ve@@ ts since 2003 .
i think that number &apos;s probably going to go up .
they &apos;re not the largest number of people , but they are some of the most expensive -- and in terms of the li@@ ke@@ li@@ hood for dom@@ esti@@ c ab@@ use , drug and al@@ co@@ hol ab@@ use , poor performance by their kids in schools and also poor health as a result of stress .
and there are pl@@ ent@@ y of other examples like that .
one problem : waste hand@@ ling and un@@ emplo@@ y@@ ment .
even when we think or talk about recycl@@ ing , lots of recycl@@ able stuff ends up getting in@@ cin@@ er@@ ated or in land@@ fil@@ ls and leaving many m@@ uni@@ ci@@ p@@ ali@@ ties , di@@ version rates -- they leave much to be recycl@@ ed .
and where is this waste hand@@ led ? usually in poor communities .
and we know that eco@@ -@@ industrial business , these kinds of business models -- there &apos;s a model in europe called the eco@@ -@@ industrial park , where either the waste of one company is the ra@@ w material for another , or you use recycl@@ ed materials to make goods that you can actually use and sell .
we can create these local markets and in@@ centi@@ ves for recycl@@ ed materials to be used as ra@@ w materials for manufacturing .
and in my home@@ town , we actually tried to do one of these in the bronx , but our ma@@ yo@@ r decided what he wanted to see was a ja@@ il on that same spot .
fortunately -- because we wanted to create hundreds of jobs -- but after many years , the city wanted to build a ja@@ il .
they &apos;ve since ab@@ and@@ oned that project , thank goo@@ dness .
another problem : un@@ healthy food systems and un@@ emplo@@ y@@ ment .
work@@ ing-@@ class and poor urban americans are not benef@@ iting econom@@ ically from our current food system .
it reli@@ es too much on transpor@@ tation , chemical ferti@@ li@@ zation , big use of water and also re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ation .
me@@ ga agri@@ cultural oper@@ ations often are responsible for po@@ is@@ oning our water@@ ways and our land , and it produ@@ ces this incredibly un@@ healthy product that costs us billions in healthcare and lost produ@@ c@@ tivity .
and so we know &quot; urban a@@ g &quot; is a big bu@@ zz top@@ ic this time of the year , but it &apos;s mostly gar@@ den@@ ing , which has some value in community building -- lots of it -- but it &apos;s not in terms of creating jobs or for food production .
the numbers just aren &apos;t there .
part of my work now is really la@@ ying the gro@@ und@@ work to integra@@ te urban a@@ g and rural food systems to ha@@ sten the de@@ mis@@ e of the 3@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ mile sal@@ ad by creating a national brand of urban@@ -@@ grown produce in every city , that uses regi@@ onal growing power and aug@@ ments it with in@@ door growing facili@@ ties , ow@@ ned and oper@@ ated by small gro@@ wers , where now there are only consum@@ ers .
this can support seas@@ onal farmers around me@@ tr@@ o areas who are losing out because they really can &apos;t meet the year-@@ round demand for produce .
it &apos;s not a competition with rural farm ; it &apos;s actually rein@@ for@@ c@@ ements .
it al@@ lies in a really positive and econom@@ ically vi@@ able food system .
the goal is to meet the cities &apos; institu@@ tional dem@@ ands for hospitals , sen@@ ior centers , schools , da@@ y@@ care centers , and produce a network of regi@@ onal jobs , as well .
this is smart infrastructure .
and how we manage our built environment affec@@ ts the health and well-@@ being of people every single day .
smart infrastructure can provide co@@ st-@@ saving ways for m@@ uni@@ ci@@ p@@ ali@@ ties to hand@@ le both infrastructure and social needs .
and we want to shift the systems that open the do@@ ors for people who were for@@ mer@@ ly ta@@ x bur@@ dens to become part of the ta@@ x base .
and imagine a national business model that creates local jobs and smart infrastructure to improve local economic st@@ ability .
so i &apos;m hop@@ ing you can see a little theme here .
these examples indi@@ cate a trend .
i haven &apos;t created it , and it &apos;s not happening by accident .
i &apos;m notic@@ ing that it &apos;s happening all over the country , and the good news is that it &apos;s growing .
and we all need to be invest@@ ed in it .
it is an essential p@@ ill@@ ar to this country &apos;s re@@ co@@ very .
and i call it &quot; home@@ town security . &quot;
the rec@@ ession has us re@@ el@@ ing and fe@@ ar@@ ful , and there &apos;s something in the air these days that is also very em@@ power@@ ing .
it &apos;s a reali@@ zation that we are the key to our own re@@ co@@ very .
now is the time for us to act in our own communities where we think local and we act local .
and when we do that , our neighb@@ ors -- be they ne@@ x@@ t-@@ door , or in the next state , or in the next country -- the sum of the local is the global .
home@@ town security means re@@ building our natural defen@@ ses , putting people to work , re@@ stor@@ ing our natural systems .
home@@ town security means creating wealth here at home , instead of destro@@ ying it over@@ se@@ as .
tac@@ kl@@ ing social and environmental problems at the same time with the same solution y@@ i@@ el@@ ds great cost sav@@ ings , wealth generation and national security .
many great and in@@ spir@@ ing solutions have been gener@@ ated across america .
the challenge for us now is to identify and support coun@@ t@@ less more .
now , home@@ town security is about taking care of your own , but it &apos;s not like the old saying , &quot; char@@ ity begins at home . &quot;
i recently read a book called &quot; love leadership &quot; by john hope br@@ y@@ ant .
and it &apos;s about leading in a world that really does seem to be operating on the basis of fear .
see , my dad was a great , great man in many ways .
he grew up in the se@@ gre@@ g@@ ated south , es@@ cap@@ ed ly@@ n@@ ching and all that during some really hard times , and he provi@@ ded a really stable home for me and my si@@ bl@@ ings and a whole bunch of other people that fell on hard times .
but , like all of us , he had some problems .
and his was gam@@ bling , comp@@ ul@@ si@@ vely .
to him that phr@@ ase , &quot; char@@ ity begins at home , &quot; meant that my pay@@ day -- or someone else &apos;s -- would just happen to co@@ in@@ cide with his lucky day .
so you need to help him out .
and sometimes i would lo@@ an him money from my after@@ -@@ school or summer jobs , and he always had the great inten@@ tion of paying me back with interest , of course , after he hit it big .
and he did sometimes , believe it or not , at a ra@@ c@@ et@@ ra@@ ck in los angeles -- one reason to love l@@ .@@ a. -- back in the 194@@ 0s .
he made 15@@ ,000 dollars c@@ ash and bought the house that i grew up in .
so i &apos;m not that un@@ happy about that .
but listen , i did feel ob@@ li@@ g@@ ated to him , and i grew up -- then i grew up .
and i &apos;m a grown woman now , and i have learned a few things along the way .
to me , char@@ ity often is just about giving , because you &apos;re supposed to , or because it &apos;s what you &apos;ve always done , or it &apos;s about giving until it hur@@ ts .
i &apos;m about provi@@ ding the means to build something that will grow and intensi@@ fy its original investment and not just require greater giving next year -- i &apos;m not trying to feed the hab@@ it .
i spent some years watching how good inten@@ tions for community em@@ power@@ ment , that were supposed to be there to support the community and em@@ power it , actually left people in the same , if not worse , position that they were in before .
and over the past 20 years , we &apos;ve spent record amo@@ unts of phil@@ anthro@@ pi@@ c dollars on social problems , yet edu@@ cational out@@ comes , mal@@ nutri@@ tion , in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation , o@@ bes@@ ity , diabetes , income dis@@ par@@ ity , they &apos;ve all gone up with some ex@@ cep@@ tions -- in particular , inf@@ ant mortality among people in poverty -- but it &apos;s a great world that we &apos;re bringing them into as well .
and i know a little bit about these issues , because , for many years , i spent a long time in the non-@@ profit industrial complex , and i &apos;m a re@@ co@@ vering ex@@ ecu@@ tive director , two years clean .
but during that time , i realized that it was about projects and developing them on the local level that really was going to do the right thing for our communities .
but i really did struggle for financial support .
the greater our success , the less money came in from foun@@ da@@ tions .
and i tell you , being on the ted stage and w@@ inning a ma@@ car@@ th@@ ur in the same ex@@ act year gave everyone the impres@@ sion that i had arrived .
and by the time i &apos;d moved on , i was actually co@@ vering a third of my agen@@ cy &apos;s budget de@@ fic@@ it with speaking fe@@ es .
but since then , the park that was just a du@@ mp and was fe@@ at@@ u@@ red at a ted@@ 2006 talk became this little thing .
but i did in fact get married in it .
over here .
there goes my dog who led me to the park in my we@@ d@@ ding .
the south bronx green@@ way was also just a drawing on the stage back in 2006 .
since then , we got about 50 million dollars in stimul@@ us pac@@ ka@@ ge money to come and get here .
and we love this , because i love construction now , because we &apos;re watching these things actually happen .
so i want everyone to understand the critical importance of shif@@ ting char@@ ity into enter@@ prise .
i started my fir@@ m to help communities across the country realize their own potential to improve everything about the quality of life for their people .
home@@ town security is next on my to-@@ do list .
what we need are people who see the value in invest@@ ing in these types of local enter@@ pris@@ es , who will partner with folks like me to identify the growth trends and climate adap@@ tation as well as understand the growing social costs of business as usual .
we need to work together to embra@@ ce and re@@ pair our land , re@@ pair our power systems and re@@ pair ourselves .
it &apos;s time to stop building the sh@@ opp@@ ing m@@ alls , the pris@@ ons , the sta@@ di@@ ums and other tribu@@ tes to all of our collective fail@@ ures .
it is time that we start building living mon@@ um@@ ents to hope and possibility .
thank you very much .
maj@@ or@@ a car@@ ter : 3 stories of local eco@@ -@@ entreprene@@ ur@@ ship
the future of green is local -- and entrepr@@ en@@ eu@@ ri@@ al . in her talk , maj@@ or@@ a car@@ ter brings us the stories of three people who are saving their own communities while saving the planet . call it &quot; home@@ town security . &quot; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
&quot; even in pur@@ ely non-@@ religious terms , homo@@ sexu@@ ality represents a mis@@ use of the sexual fac@@ ul@@ ty .
it is a pa@@ thetic little secon@@ d-@@ rate sub@@ stit@@ ute for reality -- a pi@@ ti@@ able flight from life .
as such , it deser@@ ves no compassion , it deser@@ ves no treatment as min@@ ority mar@@ ty@@ r@@ dom , and it deser@@ ves not to be de@@ em@@ ed anything but a per@@ ni@@ cious si@@ ck@@ ness . &quot;
that &apos;s from time magazine in 196@@ 6 , when i was three years old .
and last year , the president of the united states came out in fa@@ vor of gay marriage .
how did an illness become an identity ?
when i was perhaps six years old , i went to a sho@@ e store with my mother and my brother .
and at the end of buying our shoes , the sal@@ es@@ man said to us that we could each have a ballo@@ on to take home .
my brother wanted a red ballo@@ on , and i wanted a p@@ ink ballo@@ on .
my mother said that she thought i &apos;d really rather have a blue ballo@@ on .
but i said that i definitely wanted the p@@ ink one .
and she remin@@ ded me that my favorite color was blue .
the fact that my favorite color now is blue , but i &apos;m still gay -- -- is evidence of both my mother &apos;s influence and its limit@@ s .
when i was little , my mother used to say , &quot; the love you have for your children is like no other feeling in the world .
and until you have children , you don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like . &quot;
and when i was little , i took it as the greatest compli@@ ment in the world that she would say that about par@@ enting my brother and me .
and when i was an ad@@ oles@@ cent , i thought that i &apos;m gay , and so i probably can &apos;t have a family .
and when she said it , it made me an@@ xi@@ ous .
and after i came out of the clo@@ set , when she continu@@ ed to say it , it made me fu@@ ri@@ ous .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m gay . that &apos;s not the direction that i &apos;m head@@ ed in .
and i want you to stop saying that . &quot;
about 20 years ago , i was asked by my edi@@ tors at the new york times magazine to write a piece about dea@@ f culture .
and i was rather taken ab@@ ack .
i had thought of de@@ af@@ ness entirely as an illness .
those poor people , they couldn &apos;t hear .
they l@@ ac@@ ked hearing , and what could we do for them ?
and then i went out into the dea@@ f world .
i saw performan@@ ces of dea@@ f theater and of dea@@ f poetry .
i even went to the miss dea@@ f america con@@ test in nas@@ h@@ ville , ten@@ nes@@ see where people com@@ pla@@ ined about that sl@@ ur@@ ry southern sig@@ ning .
and as i pl@@ un@@ ged deeper and deeper into the dea@@ f world , i become convinced that de@@ af@@ ness was a culture and that the people in the dea@@ f world who said , &quot; we don &apos;t lack hearing , we have mem@@ ber@@ ship in a culture , &quot; were saying something that was vi@@ able .
it wasn &apos;t my culture , and i didn &apos;t particularly want to rus@@ h off and join it , but i appreci@@ ated that it was a culture and that for the people who were members of it , it felt as valuable as lat@@ in@@ o culture or gay culture or je@@ wish culture .
it felt as val@@ id perhaps even as american culture .
and when her daughter was born , she suddenly found her@@ self con@@ fron@@ ting questions that now began to seem quite res@@ on@@ ant to me .
she was facing the question of what to do with this child .
should she say , &quot; you &apos;re just like everyone else but a little bit shor@@ ter ? &quot;
or should she try to constru@@ ct some kind of d@@ war@@ f identity , get involved in the little people of america , become aware of what was happening for d@@ war@@ fs ?
and i suddenly thought , most dea@@ f children are born to hearing parents .
those hearing parents tend to try to cure them .
those dea@@ f people discover community somehow in ad@@ oles@@ c@@ ence .
most gay people are born to straight parents .
those straight parents often want them to function in what they think of as the main@@ stream world , and those gay people have to discover identity later on .
and here was this friend of mine looking at these questions of identity with her d@@ war@@ f daughter .
and i thought , there it is again : a family that percei@@ ves itself to be normal with a child who seems to be extraordinary .
and i hat@@ ched the idea that there are really two kinds of identity .
there are ver@@ tical identi@@ ties , which are passed down gener@@ a@@ tion@@ ally from par@@ ent to child .
those are things like eth@@ ni@@ city , frequ@@ ently nation@@ ality , language , often religion .
those are things you have in common with your parents and with your children .
and while some of them can be difficult , there &apos;s no attemp@@ t to cure them .
you can argue that it &apos;s harder in the united states -- our current pres@@ iden@@ cy not@@ with@@ standing -- to be a person of color .
there are these other identi@@ ties which you have to learn from a pe@@ er group .
and i call them horizon@@ tal identi@@ ties , because the pe@@ er group is the horizon@@ tal experience .
these are identi@@ ties that are alien to your parents and that you have to discover when you get to see them in pe@@ ers .
and those identi@@ ties , those horizon@@ tal identi@@ ties , people have almost always tried to cure .
and i wanted to look at what the process is through which people who have those identi@@ ties come to a good relationship with them .
and it seemed to me that there were three levels of accep@@ tan@@ ce that needed to take place .
there &apos;s self-@@ accep@@ tan@@ ce , there &apos;s family accep@@ tan@@ ce , and there &apos;s social accep@@ tan@@ ce .
and they don &apos;t always co@@ in@@ cide .
and a lot of the time , people who have these conditions are very an@@ gry because they feel as though their parents don &apos;t love them , when what actually has happened is that their parents don &apos;t accept them .
love is something that ide@@ ally is there un@@ condi@@ tion@@ ally throughout the relationship between a par@@ ent and a child .
but accep@@ tan@@ ce is something that takes time .
it always takes time .
one of the d@@ war@@ fs i got to know was a guy named clin@@ ton brown .
when he was born , he was diagno@@ sed with di@@ astrop@@ hi@@ c d@@ war@@ fis@@ m , a very dis@@ ab@@ ling condition , and his parents were told that he would never walk , he would never talk , he would have no intellectual capacity , and he would probably not even recognize them .
and it was suggest@@ ed to them that they leave him at the hospital so that he could die there quie@@ tly .
and his mother said she wasn &apos;t going to do it .
and she took her son home .
and even though she didn &apos;t have a lot of edu@@ cational or financial advan@@ tages , she found the best doctor in the country for dealing with di@@ astrop@@ hi@@ c d@@ war@@ fis@@ m , and she got clin@@ ton en@@ roll@@ ed with him .
and in the course of his childhood , he had 30 major sur@@ gical proce@@ dur@@ es .
and he spent all this time stuck in the hospital while he was having those proce@@ dur@@ es , as a result of which he now can walk .
and while he was there , they sent tu@@ tors around to help him with his school work .
and he worked very hard because there was nothing else to do .
he was the first one in his family , in fact , to go to college , where he lived on cam@@ pus and dro@@ ve a speci@@ all@@ y-@@ fit@@ ted car that ac@@ com@@ mod@@ ated his unusual body .
and his mother told me this story of coming home one day -- and he went to college ne@@ ar@@ by -- and she said , &quot; i saw that car , which you can always recognize , in the par@@ king lot of a bar , &quot; she said .
&quot; and i thought to myself , they &apos;re six feet t@@ all , he &apos;s three feet t@@ all .
two be@@ ers for them is four be@@ ers for him . &quot;
she said , &quot; i knew i couldn &apos;t go in there and inter@@ ru@@ pt him , but i went home , and i left him eight mes@@ sages on his cell phone . &quot;
she said , &quot; and then i thought , if someone had said to me when he was born that my future worry would be that he &apos;d go drin@@ king and driving with his college bud@@ dies -- &quot; and i said to her , &quot; what do you think you did that helped him to emer@@ ge as this char@@ ming , ac@@ compli@@ shed , wonderful person ? &quot;
and she said , &quot; what did i do ? i loved him , that &apos;s all .
clin@@ ton just always had that light in him .
and his father and i were lucky enough to be the first to see it there . &quot;
i &apos;m going to quote from another magazine of the &apos; 6@@ 0s .
this one is from 196@@ 8 -- the atlan@@ tic mon@@ th@@ ly , voice of liber@@ al america -- written by an important bio@@ eth@@ ic@@ ist .
he said , &quot; there is no reason to feel gu@@ il@@ ty about putting a down syndro@@ me child away , whether it is put away in the sense of hidden in a san@@ it@@ ari@@ um or in a more responsible , le@@ th@@ al sense .
it is sad , yes -- dre@@ ad@@ ful . but it car@@ ries no gu@@ il@@ t .
true gu@@ il@@ t ar@@ is@@ es only from an offen@@ se against a person , and a down &apos;s is not a person . &quot;
there &apos;s been a lot of ink given to the enormous progress that we &apos;ve made in the treatment of gay people .
the fact that our at@@ titude has changed is in the head@@ lines every day .
but we forget how we used to see people who had other differences , how we used to see people who were dis@@ ab@@ led , how in@@ human we held people to be .
and the change that &apos;s been ac@@ compli@@ shed there , which is almost equ@@ ally radical , is one that we pay not very much attention to .
one of the families i intervie@@ wed , tom and kar@@ en ro@@ bar@@ ds , were taken ab@@ ack when , as young and successful new yor@@ kers , their first child was diagno@@ sed with down syndro@@ me .
they thought the edu@@ cational opportunities for him were not what they should be , and so they decided they would build a little center -- two class@@ rooms that they started with a few other parents -- to educ@@ ate kids with d.@@ s .
and over the years , that center grew into something called the coo@@ ke center , where there are now thousands upon thousands of children with intellectual dis@@ abilities who are being taught .
in the time since that atlan@@ tic mon@@ th@@ ly story ran , the life expec@@ tan@@ cy for people with down syndro@@ me has tri@@ pl@@ ed .
the ro@@ bar@@ ds had a lot to do with that .
and i said , &quot; do you re@@ gre@@ t it ?
do you wish your child didn &apos;t have down syndro@@ me ?
do you wish you &apos;d never heard of it ? &quot;
and interest@@ ingly his father said , &quot; well , for david , our son , i re@@ gre@@ t it , because for david , it &apos;s a difficult way to be in the world , and i &apos;d like to give david an easier life .
but i think if we lost everyone with down syndro@@ me , it would be a cat@@ astrop@@ hi@@ c loss . &quot;
and kar@@ en ro@@ bar@@ ds said to me , &quot; i &apos;m with tom .
for david , i would cure it in an inst@@ ant to give him an easier life .
but speaking for myself -- well , i would never have believed 23 years ago when he was born that i could come to such a point -- speaking for myself , it &apos;s made me so much better and so much kinder and so much more pur@@ pos@@ e@@ ful in my whole life , that speaking for myself , i wouldn &apos;t give it up for anything in the world . &quot;
we live at a point when social accep@@ tan@@ ce for these and many other conditions is on the up and up .
and yet we also live at the moment when our ability to elimin@@ ate those conditions has reach@@ ed a hei@@ ght we never imag@@ ined before .
most dea@@ f in@@ fan@@ ts born in the united states now will recei@@ ve co@@ ch@@ le@@ ar im@@ plants , which are put into the brain and connected to a recei@@ ver , and which allow them to ac@@ qui@@ re a fac@@ si@@ mile of hearing and to use oral speech .
a com@@ po@@ und that has been te@@ sted in mi@@ ce , b@@ m@@ n-@@ 1@@ 11 , is useful in pre@@ vent@@ ing the action of the ach@@ on@@ dro@@ pl@@ asia gene .
ach@@ on@@ dro@@ pl@@ asia is the most common form of d@@ war@@ fis@@ m , and mi@@ ce who have been given that sub@@ stance and who have the ach@@ on@@ dro@@ pl@@ asia gene , grow to full size .
testing in humans is around the corner .
there are blood tests which are making progress that would pick up down syndro@@ me more clearly and earlier in preg@@ nan@@ cies than ever before , making it easier and easier for people to elimin@@ ate those preg@@ nan@@ cies , or to ter@@ min@@ ate them .
and so we have both social progress and medical progress .
and i believe in both of them .
i believe the social progress is fantastic and meaning@@ ful and wonderful , and i think the same thing about the medical progress .
but i think it &apos;s a trage@@ dy when one of them doesn &apos;t see the other .
and when i see the way they &apos;re inter@@ se@@ cting in conditions like the three i &apos;ve just described , i sometimes think it &apos;s like those moments in grand oper@@ a when the hero reali@@ zes he lo@@ ves the hero@@ ine at the ex@@ act moment that she lies exp@@ ir@@ ing on a di@@ van .
we have to think about how we feel about cur@@ es al@@ together .
jim sin@@ cla@@ ir , a pro@@ min@@ ent autis@@ m activ@@ ist , said , &quot; when parents say &apos; i wish my child did not have autis@@ m , &apos; what they &apos;re really saying is &apos; i wish the child i have did not exist and i had a different , non-@@ au@@ ti@@ stic child instead . &apos; read that again . this is what we hear when you m@@ our@@ n over our existence .
this is what we hear when you pra@@ y for a cure -- that your f@@ on@@ dest wish for us is that some@@ day we will ce@@ ase to be and stran@@ gers you can love will move in behind our faces . &quot;
it &apos;s a very extreme point of view , but it points to the reality that people engage with the life they have and they don &apos;t want to be cu@@ red or changed or elimin@@ ated .
they want to be who@@ ever it is that they &apos;ve come to be .
one of the families i intervie@@ wed for this project was the family of dy@@ lan k@@ leb@@ old who was one of the per@@ pe@@ tr@@ ators of the colum@@ bine mas@@ sac@@ re .
it took a long time to per@@ su@@ ade them to talk to me , and once they agre@@ ed , they were so full of their story that they couldn &apos;t stop telling it .
and the first wee@@ k@@ end i spent with them -- the first of many -- i recor@@ ded more than 20 hours of conversation .
and on sun@@ day night , we were all ex@@ hau@@ sted .
we were sitting in the kitchen . sue k@@ leb@@ old was fix@@ ing dinner .
and i said , &quot; if dy@@ lan were here now , do you have a sense of what you &apos;d want to ask him ? &quot;
and his father said , &quot; i sure do .
i &apos;d want to ask him what the hell he thought he was doing . &quot;
and sue looked at the floor , and she thought for a minute .
and then she looked back up and said , &quot; i would ask him to for@@ give me for being his mother and never knowing what was going on inside his head . &quot;
when i had dinner with her a couple of years later -- one of many din@@ ners that we had together -- she said , &quot; you know , when it first happened , i used to wish that i had never married , that i had never had children .
if i hadn &apos;t gone to o@@ hi@@ o state and cros@@ sed pa@@ ths with tom , this child wouldn &apos;t have exi@@ sted and this terrible thing wouldn &apos;t have happened .
but i &apos;ve come to feel that i love the children i had so much that i don &apos;t want to imagine a life without them .
i recognize the pain they caused to others , for which there can be no for@@ gi@@ ven@@ ess , but the pain they caused to me , there is , &quot; she said .
&quot; so while i recognize that it would have been better for the world if dy@@ lan had never been born , i &apos;ve decided that it would not have been better for me . &quot;
i thought it was surprising how all of these families had all of these children with all of these problems , problems that they mostly would have done anything to avoid , and that they had all found so much meaning in that experience of par@@ enting .
and then i thought , all of us who have children love the children we have , with their fla@@ ws .
if some gl@@ ori@@ ous ange@@ l suddenly des@@ cen@@ ded through my living room cei@@ ling and off@@ ered to take away the children i have and give me other , better children -- more poli@@ te , fun@@ ni@@ er , ni@@ cer , smar@@ ter -- i would cl@@ ing to the children i have and pra@@ y away that at@@ ro@@ cious spec@@ tac@@ le .
it turns out that while each of these individual differences is si@@ lo@@ ed -- there are only so many families dealing with schizophren@@ ia , there are only so many families of children who are trans@@ gender , there are only so many families of pro@@ di@@ gi@@ es -- who also face similar challenges in many ways -- there are only so many families in each of those categ@@ ories -- but if you start to think that the experience of negoti@@ ating difference within your family is what people are add@@ res@@ sing , then you discover that it &apos;s a nearly universal phenomenon .
ir@@ on@@ ically , it turns out , that it &apos;s our differences , and our negoti@@ ation of difference , that uni@@ te us .
i decided to have children while i was working on this project .
and many people were ast@@ on@@ ished and said , &quot; but how can you decide to have children in the mid@@ st of studying everything that can go wrong ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; i &apos;m not studying everything that can go wrong .
what i &apos;m studying is how much love there can be , even when everything appe@@ ars to be going wrong . &quot;
i thought a lot about the mother of one dis@@ ab@@ led child i had seen , a sever@@ ely dis@@ ab@@ led child who died through care@@ gi@@ ver ne@@ g@@ le@@ ct .
and when his as@@ hes were inter@@ red , his mother said , &quot; i pra@@ y here for for@@ gi@@ ven@@ ess for having been twice rob@@ bed , once of the child i wanted and once of the son i loved . &quot;
and i figured it was possible then for anyone to love any child if they had the effective will to do so .
so my husband is the biological father of two children with some les@@ bi@@ an friends in min@@ ne@@ a@@ poli@@ s .
i had a close friend from college who &apos;d gone through a di@@ vor@@ ce and wanted to have children .
and so she and i have a daughter , and mother and daughter live in texas .
and my husband and i have a son who lives with us all the time of whom i am the biological father , and our surro@@ gate for the preg@@ nan@@ cy was lau@@ ra , the les@@ bi@@ an mother of oli@@ ver and lu@@ cy in min@@ ne@@ a@@ poli@@ s .
so the shor@@ th@@ and is five parents of four children in three states .
and there are people who think that the existence of my family somehow under@@ min@@ es or we@@ ak@@ ens or dama@@ ges their family .
and there are people who think that families like mine shouldn &apos;t be allowed to exist .
and i don &apos;t accept sub@@ tra@@ ctive models of love , only addi@@ tive ones .
and i believe that in the same way that we need species diversity to en@@ sure that the planet can go on , so we need this diversity of affe@@ ction and diversity of family in order to streng@@ then the eco@@ sphere of kin@@ dness .
the day after our son was born , the pe@@ di@@ at@@ ri@@ cian came into the hospital room and said she was concerned .
he wasn &apos;t exten@@ ding his legs appropri@@ ately .
she said that might mean that he had brain damage .
in so far as he was exten@@ ding them , he was doing so as@@ y@@ m@@ me@@ tri@@ cally , which she thought could mean that there was a tumor of some kind in action .
and as she told me all of these things , i felt the very center of my being po@@ uring out onto the floor .
and i thought , here i had been working for years on a book about how much meaning people had found in the experience of par@@ enting children who are dis@@ ab@@ led , and i didn &apos;t want to join their number .
because what i was en@@ counter@@ ing was an idea of illness .
and like all parents since the da@@ wn of time , i wanted to protect my child from illness .
and i wanted also to protect myself from illness .
and yet , i knew from the work i had done that if he had any of the things we were about to start testing for , that those would ultimately be his identity , and if they were his identity they would become my identity , that that illness was going to take a very different shape as it un@@ fol@@ ded .
we took him to the mr@@ i machine , we took him to the c@@ at scan@@ ner , we took this da@@ y-@@ old child and gave him over for an ar@@ teri@@ al blood draw .
we felt hel@@ pl@@ ess .
and at the end of five hours , they said that his brain was completely clear and that he was by then exten@@ ding his legs cor@@ rec@@ tly .
and when i asked the pe@@ di@@ at@@ ri@@ cian what had been going on , she said she thought in the morning he had probably had a cra@@ mp .
but i thought how my mother was right .
i thought , the love you have for your children is unlike any other feeling in the world , and until you have children , you don &apos;t know what it feels like .
i think children had ens@@ nar@@ ed me the moment i connected fa@@ ther@@ hood with loss .
but i &apos;m not sure i would have noticed that if i hadn &apos;t been so in the thi@@ ck of this research project of mine .
i &apos;d en@@ counter@@ ed so much strange love , and i fell very naturally into its be@@ wit@@ ching patterns .
and i saw how sp@@ l@@ end@@ or can ill@@ umin@@ ate even the most ab@@ je@@ ct vulner@@ abilities .
during these 10 years , i had wit@@ n@@ essed and learned the terri@@ fying joy of unbe@@ ar@@ able responsibility , and i had come to see how it con@@ qu@@ ers everything else .
and while i had sometimes thought the parents i was intervie@@ wing were fo@@ ols , en@@ sla@@ ving themselves to a lifetime &apos;s journey with their than@@ kl@@ ess children and trying to bre@@ ed identity out of mis@@ ery , i realized that day that my research had built me a plan@@ k and that i was ready to join them on their ship .
thank you .
andre@@ w sol@@ om@@ on : love , no matter what
what is it like to raise a child who &apos;s different from you in some fundamental way ? in this quie@@ tly moving talk , writer andre@@ w sol@@ om@@ on shares what he learned from talking to do@@ zens of parents -- asking them : what &apos;s the line between un@@ condi@@ tional love and un@@ condi@@ tional accep@@ tan@@ ce ?
most people don &apos;t know that when i went to high school in this country -- i applied for university at a time when i was convinced i was going to be an artist and be a sculp@@ tor .
my family was weal@@ thy , and my father believed in one thing , and that was to give us all as much education as we wanted .
and i announ@@ ced i wanted to be a sculp@@ tor in paris .
and he was a clever man . he sort of said , &quot; well , that &apos;s ok , but you &apos;ve done very well in your math s@@ ats . &quot;
in fact , i &apos;d got an 800 . and he thought i did very well -- and i did , too -- in the arts : this was my passion .
and he said &quot; if you go to mit , &quot; to which i had been given early ad@@ mission , &quot; i will pay for every year you &apos;re at mit , in graduate or under@@ graduate -- as much as you want -- i will pay for an equal number of years for you to live in paris . &quot;
and i thought that was the best deal in town , so i accep@@ ted it immediately .
and i decided that if i was good in art , and i was good in mathematics , i &apos;d study architecture , which was the bl@@ en@@ ding of the two .
i went and told my head@@ master that , at pre@@ p school .
and i said to him what i was doing , that i was going to go study architecture because it was art and mathematics put together .
he said to me something that just went completely over my head .
he said , &quot; you know , i like gre@@ y su@@ its , and i like p@@ in-@@ stri@@ ped su@@ its , but i don &apos;t like gre@@ y p@@ in-@@ stri@@ ped su@@ its . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; what a tur@@ key this guy is , &quot; and i went off to mit .
i studied architecture , then did a second degree in architecture , and then actually quickly realized that it wasn &apos;t architecture .
that really , the mix@@ ing of art and science was computers , and that that really was the place to bring both , and enjo@@ yed a career doing that .
and probably , if i were to fill out jim c@@ it@@ r@@ in &apos;s scale , i &apos;d put 100 percent on the side of the equ@@ ation where you spend time making it possible for others to be creative .
and after doing this for a long time , and the media lab pas@@ sing the bat@@ on on , i thought , &quot; well , maybe it &apos;s time for me to do a project .
something that would be important , but also something that would take advantage of all of these privi@@ le@@ ges that one had . &quot;
and in the case of the media lab , knowing a lot of people , knowing people who were either ex@@ ecu@@ tives or weal@@ thy , and also not having , in my own case , a career to worry about anymore .
my career , i mean , i &apos;d done my career .
didn &apos;t have to worry about ear@@ ning money .
didn &apos;t have to worry about what people thought about me .
and i said , &quot; boy , let &apos;s really do something that takes advantage of all these fe@@ atures , &quot; and thought that if we could address education , by le@@ ver@@ aging the children , and bringing to the world the access of the computers , that that was really the thing we should do .
it &apos;s taken at three o &apos;@@ clock in the morning , without the per@@ mission of the company .
it &apos;s about two weeks old . there they are , folks .
if you look at the picture , you &apos;ll see they &apos;re stac@@ ked up .
those are con@@ ve@@ yo@@ r bel@@ ts that go around .
this is one of the con@@ ve@@ yo@@ r bel@@ ts with the thing going by , but then you &apos;ll see the ones up above .
what happens is , they burn into flas@@ h memory the software , and then test them for a few hours .
but you &apos;ve got to have the thing moving on the assem@@ bly line , because it &apos;s const@@ ant .
so they go around in this loo@@ p , which is why you see them up there .
so this was great for us because it was a real turning point . but it goes back .
this picture was taken in 198@@ 2 , just before the ib@@ m p@@ c was even announ@@ ced .
se@@ y@@ m@@ our pa@@ per@@ t and i were bringing computers to schools and developing nations at a time when it was way ahead of itself .
but one thing we learned was that these kids can absolutely jump into it just the same way as our kids do here .
and when people tell me , &quot; who &apos;s going to teach the teachers to teach the kids ? &quot;
i say to myself , &quot; what planet do you come from ? &quot;
okay , there &apos;s not a person in this room -- i don &apos;t care how tech@@ ie you are -- there &apos;s not a person in this room that doesn &apos;t give their laptop or cell phone to a kid to help them de@@ bu@@ g it . ok ?
we all need help , even those of us who are very seas@@ oned .
this picture of se@@ y@@ m@@ our -- 25 years ago . se@@ y@@ m@@ our made a very simple obser@@ vation in 196@@ 8 , and then basically pres@@ ented it in 19@@ 70 -- apri@@ l 11 to be pre@@ cise -- called &quot; teaching children thinking . &quot;
what he obser@@ ved was that kids who write computer programs understand things differently , and when they de@@ bu@@ g the programs , they come the clo@@ s@@ est to learning about learning .
that was very important , and in some sense , we &apos;ve lost that .
kids don &apos;t program enough and boy , if there &apos;s anything i hope this brings back , it &apos;s progra@@ mming to kids .
it &apos;s really important . using appli@@ cations is ok , but progra@@ mming is absolutely fundamental .
this is being launched with three languages in it : squ@@ e@@ ak , lo@@ go , and a third , that i &apos;ve never even seen before .
this photograph is very important because it &apos;s much later .
this is in the early 200@@ 0s . my son , di@@ mit@@ ri -- who &apos;s here , many of you know di@@ mit@@ ri -- went to cam@@ bo@@ dia , set up this school that we had built , just as the school connected it to the internet .
and these kids had their laptops . but it was really what spi@@ ri@@ ted this , plus the influence of joe and others . we started one laptop per child .
this is the same village in cam@@ bo@@ dia , just a couple of months ago .
these kids are real pro@@ s . there were just 7@@ ,000 machines out there being te@@ sted by kids . being a non@@ profit is absolutely fundamental .
everybody ad@@ vis@@ ed me not to be a non@@ profit , but they were all wrong .
and the reason being a non@@ profit is important is actually two@@ fold .
there are many reasons , but the two that mer@@ it the little bit of time is : one , the c@@ lar@@ ity of purpose is there . the moral purpose is clear .
i can see any head of state , any ex@@ ecu@@ tive i want , at any time , because i &apos;m not selling laptops . ok ? i have no sh@@ are@@ hol@@ ders .
whether we sell , it doesn &apos;t make any difference what@@ so@@ ever .
the c@@ lar@@ ity of purpose is absolutely critical . and the second is very counter@@ intui@@ tive -- you can get the best people in the world .
if you look at our professional services , including search fir@@ ms , including communic@@ ations , including legal services , including ban@@ king , they &apos;re all pro bon@@ o . and it &apos;s not to save money .
we &apos;ve got money in the bank . it &apos;s because you get the best people .
you get the people who are doing it because they believe in the mission , and they &apos;re the best people .
we couldn &apos;t afford to hi@@ re a c@@ f@@ o . we put out a job descri@@ ption for a c@@ f@@ o at zero sal@@ ary , and we had a qu@@ eu@@ e of people .
it allows you to team up with people . the u.n. &apos; s not going to be our partner if we &apos;re profit making . so announ@@ cing this with ko@@ f@@ i an@@ n@@ an was very important , and the u.n. allowed us to basically reach all the countries . and this was the machine we were showing before i met y@@ ves beha@@ r .
and while this machine in some sense is sil@@ ly , in retro@@ spe@@ ct , it actually ser@@ ved a very important purpose .
that pen@@ c@@ il@@ -@@ yellow cr@@ ank was remem@@ ber@@ ed by everybody .
everybody remem@@ ber@@ ed the pen@@ c@@ il@@ -@@ yellow cr@@ ank . it &apos;s different .
it was getting its power in a different way . it &apos;s kind of child@@ like .
even though this wasn &apos;t the direction we went because the cr@@ ank -- it really is stupid to have it on board , by the way .
in spi@@ te of what some people in the press don &apos;t get it , didn &apos;t understand it , we didn &apos;t take it off because we didn &apos;t want to do -- having it on the laptop itself is really not what you want .
i didn &apos;t bring one with me , but they really work much better off@@ -@@ board .
and then , i could tell you lots about the laptop , but i decided on just four things .
just keep in mind -- because there are other people , including bill gates , who said , &quot; ge@@ e , you &apos;ve got a real computer . &quot;
that computer is unlike anything you &apos;ve had , and does things -- there are four of them -- that you don &apos;t come close to . and it &apos;s very important to be low power , and i hope that &apos;s picked up more by the industry .
that the reason that you want to be below two wat@@ ts is that &apos;s roughly what you can generate with your upp@@ er body .
du@@ al-@@ mode display -- that sun@@ light display &apos;s fantastic .
we were using it at lunch today in the sun@@ light , and the more sun@@ light the better .
and that was really critical . the mes@@ h network , it &apos;ll become common@@ place .
and of course , &quot; ru@@ g@@ ged &quot; goes without saying .
and the reason i think design matters isn &apos;t because i wanted to go to art school .
and by the way , when i gradu@@ ated from mit , i thought the worst and si@@ lli@@ est thing to do would be to go to paris for six years .
so , i didn &apos;t do that . but design matters for a number of reasons .
the most important being that it is the best way to make an in@@ expensive product .
most people make in@@ expensive products by taking cheap design , cheap labor , cheap components , and making a cheap laptop .
and , in english , the word &quot; cheap &quot; has a double meaning , which is really appropriate , because it &apos;s cheap , in the pe@@ j@@ or@@ ative sense , as well as in@@ expensive .
but if you take a different approach , and you think of very lar@@ ge-@@ scale integra@@ tion , very advanced materials , very advanced manufacturing -- so you &apos;re po@@ uring chemicals in one end , ipo@@ ds are spe@@ wing out the other -- and really cool design , that &apos;s what we wanted to do .
and i can race through these and save a lot of time because y@@ ves and i obviously didn &apos;t compare notes .
these are his sli@@ des , and so i don &apos;t have to talk about them .
it wasn &apos;t just to kind of make it c@@ ute , because somebody -- you know , good design is very important .
y@@ ves showed one of the power@@ -@@ gener@@ ating devices .
the mes@@ h network , the reason i -- and i won &apos;t go into it in great detail -- but when we deliver laptops to kids in the re@@ mot@@ est and poor@@ est parts of the world , they &apos;re connected . there &apos;s not just laptops .
it &apos;s a lot of stuff that goes behind these . these can talk to each other .
if you &apos;re in the jung@@ le , it &apos;s about 500 meters . so if a kid bi@@ cy@@ cles home , or wal@@ ks a few miles , they &apos;re going to be off the grid , so to speak .
they &apos;re not going to be near another laptop , so you have to na@@ il these onto a tree , and sort of , get it .
you don &apos;t call ver@@ i@@ zon or spr@@ int . you build your own network .
and that &apos;s very important , the user interface .
we are laun@@ ching with 18 key@@ bo@@ ards . english is by far the min@@ ority .
la@@ tin is relatively rare , too . you just look at some of the languages .
i &apos;m willing to sus@@ pe@@ ct some of you hadn &apos;t even heard of them before .
is there anybody in the room , one person , unless you work with ol@@ p@@ c , is there anybody in the room that can tell me what language the key@@ board is that &apos;s on the screen ? there &apos;s only one hand -- so you get it .
yes , you &apos;re right . he &apos;s right . it &apos;s am@@ har@@ ic , it &apos;s ethi@@ op@@ ian . in ethi@@ op@@ ia , there &apos;s never been a key@@ board .
there is no key@@ board standard because there &apos;s no market .
and this is the big difference .
again , when you &apos;re a non@@ profit , you look at children as a mission , not as a market .
so we went to ethi@@ op@@ ia , and we helped them make a key@@ board .
and this will become the standard ethi@@ op@@ ian key@@ board .
so what i want to end with is sort of what we &apos;re doing to roll it out .
and we changed strategy completely . i decided at the beginning -- it was a pretty good thing to decide in the beginning , it &apos;s not what we &apos;re doing now -- is to go to six countries .
big countries , one of them is not so big , but it &apos;s rich .
here &apos;s the six . we went to the six , and in each case the head of state said he would do it , he &apos;d do a million .
we thought , this is exactly the right strategy , get it out , and then the little countries could sort of pig@@ gy@@ back on these big countries .
and so i went to each of those countries at least six times , met with the head of state probably two or three times .
in each case , got the mini@@ sters , went through a lot of the stuff .
this was a period in my life where i was travel@@ ing 3@@ 30 days per year .
in the case of li@@ b@@ ya , it was a lot of fun meeting g@@ ad@@ da@@ f@@ i in his tent .
the cam@@ el sm@@ ells were un@@ belie@@ vable .
and it was 45 degrees c. i mean , this was not what you &apos;d call a cool experience . and former countries -- i say former , because none of them really came through this summer -- there was a big difference between getting a head of state to have a photo opportunity , make a press rele@@ ase .
so we went to smaller ones . ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay , bl@@ ess their he@@ arts .
small country , not so rich . president said he &apos;d do it , and guess what ?
he did do it . the ten@@ der had nothing in it that related to us , nothing specific about sun@@ ligh@@ t-@@ read@@ able , mes@@ h-@@ network , low-@@ power , but just a van@@ ill@@ a laptop pro@@ pos@@ al .
and guess what ? we won it hands down .
when it was announ@@ ced that they were going to do every child in ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay , the first 100,000 , bo@@ om , went to ol@@ p@@ c .
the next day -- the next day , not even 24 hours had passed -- in per@@ u , the president of per@@ u said , &quot; we &apos;ll do 250 . &quot; and bo@@ om , a little domin@@ o effect .
the president of r@@ wand@@ a ste@@ pped in and said he would do it .
